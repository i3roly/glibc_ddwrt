This document describes
in terse form
the features
of the \*(ME macro package
for \*G.
Some familiarity with the latter is assumed.
Specifically,
the reader should understand
breaks;
filling;
adjustment;
font selection;
type sizes;
the definition and use of
registers,
strings,
and macros;
and typographical units of measurement:
points, ems, ens, and vees.
For a more casual introduction
to text processing,
refer to
.\" the document \" slack phrasing for widow/orphan control
.q "Writing Papers with \*G using \-\*(ME" .
.pp
Many of the package's rendering parameters
can be adjusted through
registers,
strings,
and macro calls.
Macro arguments are denoted with lowercase letters for
numeric values
(suffixed with a scaling unit if appropriate)
and with uppercase for text arguments.
Default parameter values are shown in square brackets.
The notation
.i \(+-n
indicates a numerical value with an optional leading sign.
Without the sign,
it assigns a value
.i n.
With it,
it expresses alteration of an existing value by the amount
.i n.
\*(ME's font registers may be set only to mounting positions.
Position zero tells \*(ME to perform no font change;
the font of the preceding text
is used instead.
Position zero is a
.q pseudo-font ;
that is,
it is interpreted and handled by the macros.
In contrast,
using position zero
may produce unexpected results
in a font selection escape sequence such as
.b \ef0 ,
because those are interpreted directly by \*T.
\*(ME's type size registers support only integral values in points.
Changes to parameters
that affect the layout of the page
(notably page length and vertical margins)
should be done before calling
any paragraphing or sectioning macros.
Normally,
vertical space is suppressed at the top of a page
if no text has yet appeared
(page headers notwithstanding).
.pp
\*G measures distances
in device-specific basic units,
so it is often necessary
to specify measurements with a scaling unit.
For instance,
to set the paragraph indentation
to eight ens,
input
.q ".nr pi 8n" .
.q ".nr pi 8"
makes the paragraph indentation eight basic units,
or 8/72,000 inches on
.i grops,
\*G's PostScript output driver.
.pp
Registers and strings
with names of the form
.b $ \c
.bi x
may be used in expressions and text
but should not be changed.
Macros with names of the form
.b $ \c
.bi x
are
.i hooks,
called internally by \*(ME,
and can be redefined
to alter their function.
This may be a sensitive operation;
look at the macro definition in the
.i e.tmac
file before changing it.
If you don't require a given hook,
(re)define it as empty instead of removing it.
.pp
Objects in \*(ME
follow a rigid naming convention.
To avoid conflict,
any user-defined register,
string,
or macro
names should be single numerals or uppercase letters,
or any longer character sequence
including at least one uppercase letter.\**
.(f
\**
For portability between BSD and \*G \*(ME,
limit names to
two characters,
and avoid names starting with
.b [
(left square bracket).
.)f
The names employed
by any preprocessors in use
should also not be repurposed.

.sh 1 "Paragraphing"
.TL
.b .lp
.DE
Begin left-aligned paragraph.
Centering,
right-alignment,
and underlining are canceled.
The font is set to
.NR (pf
[1],
the type size
to
.NR (pp
[10p],
and vertical spacing
(text baseline spacing)
to
.NR (tv
[120]%
of the type size.
Vertical space of
.NR (ps
[0.35v]
is inserted
before the paragraph.
The indentation is reset
to
.NR ($i
[0]
plus
.NR (po
[0]
unless the paragraph
is inside a display
(see
.b .ba ).
At least
the first two output lines
of the paragraph
are kept together
on a page.
.TL
.b .pp
.DE
Like
.b .lp ,
but apply a (further) indentation of
.NR (pi
[5n]
to the first output line.
.TL
.b .ip
.i T
.i i
.DE
Like
.b .lp ,
but set the paragraph
with an optional hanging tag
.i T
[empty]
and the remainder indented by
.i i
[\c
.NR (ii
[5n]].
The tag
.i T
is
.q exdented
(the opposite of
.i in dented).
Any spaces in
.i T
must be unbreakable.
If
.i T
does not fit in the space
.i i,
.b .ip
breaks the line after
.i T .
.TL
.b .np
.DE
Like
.b .ip ,
but tag the paragraph with a number in parentheses,
starting at 1.
Each subsequent
.b .np
call increments it.
The paragraph number is stored in
.NR ($p
and reset to 1 by
.b .lp ,
.b .pp ,
.b .bu ,
.b .sh ,
and
.b .sx .
.TL
.b .bu

Like
.b .ip ,
except that the tag is a bullet (\(bu).
No vertical space is inserted
between adjacent bulleted paragraphs,

enabling the construction of compact itemized lists.
.sh 1 "Sectioning"
.pp
Numbered sections
are similar to paragraphs
except that a
section number of the form
.q 1.2.3
is automatically
generated for each.
\*(ME supports up to six levels of sectioning;
any given section has a
.i depth
that determines
the quantity of components
(separated by dots)
shown in its section number.
Unnumbered section headings are similar,
except that no number is prefixed
to the section title.
.TL
.b .sh
.i \(+-n
.i T
.i "a b c d e f"
.DE
Begin section with numbered heading
of depth
.i \(+-n
[+0]
and optional title
.i T
[empty].
Vertical space of
.NR (ss
[1v]
precedes the heading.
The components
of the section number
are maintained in
.NR ($1
through
.NR ($6 ;
combined,
they are available in
.ST ($n .
Automatic section numbering at all depths begins at 1.
The heading is set in font
.NR (sf
[3]
at size
.NR (sp
[10p]
and uses the indentation of its parent depth;
a further indentation of
.NR (so
[0]
is applied only to its output line.
The section number is followed by a period,
after which the typeface is set
to the paragraph font
.NR (pf
at size
.NR (pp
so that content may follow immediately
on the same output line.
.b .sh
ensures that there is enough room
to format the section heading
with the beginning of a paragraph on the same page
(about 3 lines total).
If any of
.i a
through
.i f
[all empty]
is specified,
each component of the section number
is assigned the corresponding argument
instead of being automatically adjusted.
A hyphen
(\c
.q \- )
for a component argument
prevents its alteration.
If
.i T
is an underscore
(\c
.q _ ),
the section depth and numbering are reset,
the base indentation is not,
and nothing is output\(em\c
.\" TODO: Move the following application note to meintro.me.in or some

this is useful to automatically
coordinate section numbers with
chapter numbers.
If all components are zero,
no number is output.
.TL
.b .sx
.i \(+-n
.DE
Go to section depth
.i \(+-n
[\-1],
but emit no section heading
and do not increment the section number.
This has the effect of an
.b .lp
call
at the new depth.
.TL
.b .uh
.i T
.DE
Begin unnumbered section.
Like
.b .sh ,
without the section numbering features.
.TL
.b .$p
.i T
.i B
.i n
.DE
Output section heading.
.i T
is the title,
.i B
is the concatenated number,
and
.i n
is the depth.
These parameters are not always present;
.b .sh
passes all three,
.b .uh
only the first,
and
.b .sx
all three,
but the first two
are empty.
If
.i n
is present,
the section indentation is set to
.NR (si
times\~\c
.i n .
.TL
.b .$0
.i T
.i B
.i n
.DE
This hook macro,
normally empty,
is called automatically
by
.b .sh
and
.b .uh
after they call
.b .$p ,
and is passed the same arguments.
.\" TODO: Move the following application note to meintro.me.in or some
.\" future non-introductory me(7) usage manual.
You can define it to,
for instance,
automatically put
each section title
into a table of contents
using
.b .(x
and
.b .)x .
.TL
.b .$ \c
.bi n
.DE
These hook macros
(where
.i n
is an integer 1\(en6)
are called by
.b .$p
just before it outputs
a section heading
of depth
.i n.

to obtain section depth-dependent spacing.
.sh 1 "Headers, Footers, and Margins"
.ds TP \(aq\,\fIL\/\fP\(aq\,\fIM\/\fP\(aq\,\fIR\/\fP\(aq
.pp
Headers and footers
are known as
.i "three-part titles"
for their left,
middle,
and right-hand components
.i L,
.i M,
and
.i R.
The components are separated
by a
.i delimiter,
shown here as a neutral apostrophe,
but which can be any character
that does not occur in any of the components.
Any defined title is
placed on the page automatically,
set in font
.NR (tf
[3]
at size
.NR (tp
[10p].
Each title definition
applies starting with the
.i next
page;
titles intended for output on the first page
should be defined prior to any sectioning or paragraphing macro calls.
A title
must be quoted
if it contains more than two adjacent spaces
or more than eight spaces total.
.pp
The placement
of headers and footers
is controlled by four registers
initialized to values scaled
with respect to the default type size and vertical spacing.
.NR (hm
[4v]
is the distance from the top of the page
to the top of the header,
.NR (fm
[3v]
that from the bottom of the page
to the bottom of the footer,
.NR (tm
[7v]
that from the top of the page
to the top of the text,
and
.NR (bm
[6v]
that from the bottom of the page
to the (nominal) bottom of the text.
.pp
\*(ME uses \*T's environment 0 for body text,
1 for keeps
(see below),
and 2 for headers and footers.
The default line length is two inches less than the page width
(e.g.,
6.5i on U.S.\& letter paper).
The default page offset
(left margin)
is determined by the output device;
it is typically 1.0i on typesetting devices and 0 on terminals.
.TL
.b .xl
.i \(+-n
.DE
Set line length to
.i n
[see above]
only in the current environment.

Begin a

of chapter and page numbers.
The chapter number in
.NR (ch
is reset to\~0.
A segment uses Arabic numerals
for chapter and page numbers
except where noted.
The mandatory segment type argument
.i S
must be one of
.b C
for chapters
(of the main matter),
.b A
for appendices
(uppercase alphabetical chapter numbers),
.b P
for preliminary (\(lqfront\(rq) matter
(such as a foreword;
lowercase Roman page numbers),
.b AB
for an abstract
(page numbering restarts at 1),
or
.b B
for \(lqback\(rq matter,
such as a bibliography.
.b C
or
.b A
may be prefixed with
.b R ,
which specifies a restart of page numbering
when
.b .+c
is called within the applicable segment.
If present,
the
.i H
[empty]
parameter defines the new header,
which must be delimited as a three-part title\(em\c
if it contains spaces,
it must furthermore be quoted.
To include the chapter number in

These strings are limited in multiple respects:
they can have a crude appearance,
they are unrecognizable on character-cell video terminals

.uh Summary
.pp
Almost all macros,
strings,
and registers
available in the \*(ME package
are summarized below;
the legacy strings from section
.q "Special Characters"
are omitted.
Selected \*T
requests,
registers,
and escape sequences are included as well;
those listed can generally be used with impunity.
The list is sorted by Unicode code point
(basic Latin subset)
keyed on the identifier:
escape and control characters are disregarded,
as are the escape function selectors for register and string
interpolation,
.b n
and
.b * .
.pp
Each row contains the name of the
macro (or request),
register,
string,
or escape function;
a code for the name's type
(one of the foregoing);
and its description.
The type codes are
.b M
for a macro or \*T
request
(shown prefixed with the control character
.b . ,
but the no-break control character
.b \(aq
can also be used),
.b S
for a string
(shown using its interpolation syntax,
.b \e*
or
.b \e*( ),
.b R
for a register
(shown using its interpolation syntax,
.b \en
or
.b \en( ),
and
.b F
for a \*T built-in function
(shown prefixed with the escape character
.b \e ).
.pp
The type code can carry a variety of annotations.
A section sign \(sc indicates features interpreted by \*T
rather than the \*(ME package.
The dagger \(dg and double dagger \(dd identify user-definable macros.
Those marked with
\(dd have default definitions;
changing them may have unexpected side effects.
The degree sign \(de notes features requiring AT&T device-independent
\*T extensions
(ca.\& 1981),
and a square \(sq labels \*G extensions.
