[1mDescription[0m
       [4maddftinfo[24m  reads  an  AT&T [4mtroff[24m font description file [4mfont[24m, adds addi‐
       tional font metric information required by GNU [4mtroff[24m(1), and writes the
       combined  result  to the standard output.  The information added is de‐
       rived from the font’s existing parameters and assumptions about  tradi‐
       tional  [4mtroff[24m  names  for characters.  Among the font metrics added are
       the heights and depths of characters (how far each  extends  vertically
       above and below the baseline).  The [4mresolution[24m and [4munit‐width[24m arguments
       should be the same as the corresponding parameters in  the  [4mDESC[24m  file.
       [4mfont[24m  is  the  name  of the file describing the font; if [4mfont[24m ends with
       “[1mI[22m”, the font is assumed to be oblique (or italic).

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mafmtodit[24m  adapts  an Adobe Font Metric file, [4mafm‐file[24m, for use with the
       [1mps [22mand [1mpdf [22moutput devices of [4mtroff[24m(1).  [4mmap‐file[24m associates a [4mgroff[24m or‐
       dinary  or special character name with a PostScript glyph name.  Output
       is written in [4mgroff_font[24m(5) format  to  [4mfont‐description‐file,[24m  a  file
       named for the intended [4mgroff[24m font name (but see the [1m-o [22moption).

       [4mmap‐file[24m should contain a sequence of lines of the form
              [4mps‐glyph[24m [4mgroff‐char[0m
       where  [4mps‐glyph[24m  is the PostScript glyph name and [4mgroff‐char[24m is a [4mgroff[0m
       ordinary (if of unit length) or special (if longer)  character  identi‐
       fier.   The  same  [4mps‐glyph[24m  can occur multiple times in the file; each
       [4mgroff‐char[24m must occur at most once.  Lines starting with “#” and  blank
       lines  are  ignored.  If the file isn’t found in the current directory,
       it is sought in the [4mdevps/generate[24m subdirectory of the default font di‐
       rectory.

       If a PostScript glyph is not mentioned in [4mmap‐file[24m, and a [4mgroff[24m charac‐
       ter name can’t be deduced using the Adobe Glyph List (AGL,  built  into
       [4mafmtodit[24m),  then [4mafmtodit[24m puts the PostScript glyph into the [4mgroff[24m font
       description file as an unnamed glyph which can only be accessed by  the
       “\N”  escape  sequence in a [4mroff[24m document.  In particular, this is true
       for glyph variants named in the form “[4mfoo[24m.[4mbar[24m”; all  glyph  names  con‐
       taining  one or more periods are mapped to unnamed entities.  Unless [1m-e[0m
       is specified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e., entries  with
       non‐negative  codes)  is  used.   Refer  to  section “Using Symbols” in
       [4mGroff:[24m [4mThe[24m [4mGNU[24m [4mImplementation[24m [4mof[24m [4mtroff[24m, the [4mgroff[24m  Texinfo  manual,  or
       [4mgroff_char[24m(7),  which describe how [4mgroff[24m character identifiers are con‐
       structed.

       Glyphs not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries indexed as “-1”)  are
       still  available in [4mgroff[24m; they get glyph index values greater than 255
       (or greater than the biggest code used in the AFM file in the  unlikely
       case  that  it is greater than 255) in the [4mgroff[24m font description file.
       Unencoded glyph indices don’t have a specific order; it is best to  ac‐
       cess them only via special character identifiers.

       If the font file proper (not just its metrics) is available, listing it
       in  the  files  [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/download[24m  and  [4m/usr/[0m
       [4mshare/groff/1.23.0/font/devpdf/download[24m  enables  it  to be embedded in
       the output produced by [4mgrops[24m(1) and [4mgropdf[24m(1), respectively.

       If the [1m-i [22moption is used, [4mafmtodit[24m automatically  generates  an  italic
       correction,  a  left  italic correction, and a subscript correction for
       each glyph (the significance of these is explained  in  [4mgroff_font[24m(5));
       they  can  be specified for individual glyphs by adding to the [4mafm‐file[0m
       lines of the form:
              italicCorrection [4mps‐glyph[24m [4mn[0m
              leftItalicCorrection [4mps‐glyph[24m [4mn[0m
              subscriptCorrection [4mps‐glyph[24m [4mn[0m
       where [4mps‐glyph[24m is the PostScript glyph name, and [4mn[24m is the desired value
       of  the  corresponding parameter in thousandths of an em.  Such parame‐
       ters are normally needed only for italic (or oblique) fonts.

       The [1m-s [22moption should be given if the font is  “special”,  meaning  that
       [4mgroff[24m  should  search  it  whenever a glyph is not found in the current
       font.  In that case, [4mfont‐description‐file[24m should be listed as an argu‐
       ment  to the [1mfonts [22mdirective in the output device’s [4mDESC[24m file; if it is
       not special, there is no need to do so, since [4mtroff[24m(1)  will  automati‐
       cally mount it when it is first used.

              By default [4mafmtodit[24m uses the negative of the [1mItalicAngle  [22mspeci‐
              fied in the AFM file; with true italic fonts it is sometimes de‐
              sirable to use a slant that is less than this.  If you find that
              an  italic  font  places accents over base glyphs too far to the
              right, use [1m-a [22mto give it a smaller slant.

              The device description file is [4mdesc‐file[24m rather than the default
              [4mDESC[24m.  If not found in the current directory, the  [4mdevps[24m  subdi‐
              rectory  of the default font directory is searched (this is true
              for both the default device description file and  a  file  given
              with option [1m-d[22m).

       [1m-e [4m[22mencoding‐file[0m
              The  PostScript font should be reencoded to use the encoding de‐
              scribed in [4menc‐file[24m.  The format of  [4menc‐file[24m  is  described  in
              [4mgrops[24m(1).  If not found in the current directory, the [4mdevps[24m sub‐
              directory of the default font directory is searched.

       [1m-f [4m[22minternal‐name[0m
              The internal name of the [4mgroff[24m font is set to [4mname[24m.

       [1m-i [4m[22mitalic‐correction‐factor[0m
              Generate an italic correction for each glyph so that  its  width
              plus  its italic correction is equal to [4mitalic‐correction‐factor[0m
              thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the right edge  of
              the glyph’s bounding box is to the right of its origin.  If this
              would result in a negative italic correction, use a zero  italic
              correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x‐height
              of  the  font.   If  this would result in a subscript correction
              greater than the italic correction, use a  subscript  correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also  generate  a left italic correction for each glyph equal to
              [4mitalic‐correction‐factor[24m thousandths of an em plus the amount by
              which  the  left edge of the glyph’s bounding box is to the left
              of its origin.  The left italic correction may be  negative  un‐
              less option [1m-m [22mis given.

              This  option  is  normally  needed only with italic (or oblique)
              fonts.  The font description files distributed with  [4mgroff[24m  were

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mchem[24m produces chemical structure diagrams.   Today’s  version  is  best
       suited  for  organic  chemistry  (bonds, rings).  The [4mchem[24m program is a
       [4mgroff[24m preprocessor like [4meqn[24m, [4mpic[24m, [4mtbl[24m, etc.  It  generates  [4mpic[24m  output
       such  that  all [4mchem[24m parts are translated into diagrams of the [4mpic[24m lan‐
       guage.

       If no operands are given, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mchem[24m  reads  the  standard
       input  stream.   [1m-h  [22mand [1m--help [22mdisplay a usage message, whereas [1m-v [22mand
       [1m--version [22mdisplay version information; all exit.

       The program [4mchem[24m originates from the  Perl  source  file  [4mchem.pl[24m.   It
       tells  [4mpic[24m  to include a copy of the macro file [4mchem.pic[24m.  Moreover the
       [4mgroff[24m source file [4mpic.tmac[24m is loaded.

       In a style reminiscent of [4meqn[24m and [4mpic[24m, the [4mchem[24m diagrams are written in
       a special language.

       A set of [4mchem[24m lines looks like this

              .cstart
              [4mchem[24m [4mdata[0m
              .cend

       Lines containing the keywords [1m.cstart [22mand [1m.cend [22mstart and end the input
       for [4mchem[24m, respectively.  In [4mpic[24m context, i.e., after the call  of  [1m.PS[22m,
       [4mchem[24m  input  can optionally be started by the line [1mbegin chem [22mand ended
       by the line with the single word [1mend [22minstead.

       Anything outside these initialization lines is copied  through  without
       modification;  all  data  between the initialization lines is converted
       into [4mpic[24m commands to draw the diagram.

       As an example,

              .cstart
              CH3
              bond
              CH3
              .cend

       prints two [1mCH3 [22mgroups with a bond between them.

       If you want to create just [4mgroff[24m output, you must run [4mchem[24m followed  by
       [4mgroff[24m with the option [1m-p [22mfor the activation of [4mpic[24m:

              [4mchem[24m [[4mfile[24m ...] [1m| groff -p [22m...

[1mLanguage[0m
       The  [4mchem[24m input language is rather small.  It provides rings of several
       styles and a way to glue them together as  desired,  bonds  of  several
       styles, moieties (e.g., [1mC[22m, [1mNH3[22m, ..., and strings.

   [1mSetting variables[0m
       There  are  some  variables that can be set by commands.  Such commands
       have two possible forms, either

              [4mvariable[24m [4mvalue[0m

       or

              [4mvariable[24m [1m= [4m[22mvalue[0m

       This sets the given [4mvariable[24m to the argument [4mvalue[24m.  If more  arguments
       are  given only the last argument is taken, all other arguments are ig‐
       nored.

       There are only a few variables to be set by these commands:

       [1mtextht [4m[22marg[0m
              Set the height of the text to [4marg[24m; default is 0.16.

       [1mcwid [4m[22marg[0m
              Set the character width to [4marg[24m; default is 0.12.

       [1mdb [4m[22marg[24m Set the bond length to [4marg[24m; default is 0.2.

       [1msize [4m[22marg[0m
              Scale the diagram to make it look plausible at point  size  [4marg[24m;
              default is 10 point.

   [1mBonds[0m
       This

              [1mbond [22m[[4mdirection[24m] [[4mlength[24m [4mn[24m] [[1mfrom [4m[22mName[24m|[4mpicstuff[24m]

       draws a single bond in direction from nearest corner of [4mName[24m.  [1mbond [22mcan
       also be [1mdouble bond[22m, [1mfront bond[22m, [1mback bond[22m, etc.  (We will get back  to
       [4mName[24m soon.)

       [4mdirection[24m  is  the angle in degrees (0 up, positive clockwise) or a di‐
       rection word like [1mup[22m, [1mdown[22m, [1msw [22m(= southwest), etc.  If no direction  is
       specified,  the bond goes in the current direction (usually that of the
       last bond).

       Normally the bond begins at  the  last  object  placed;   this  can  be
       changed  by  naming a [1mfrom [22mplace.  For instance, to make a simple alkyl
       chain:
              [1mCH3[0m
              [1mbond                [22m(this one goes right from the CH3)
              [1mC                   [22m(at the right end of the bond)
              [1mdouble bond up      [22m(from the C)
              [1mO                   [22m(at the end of the double bond)
              [1mbond right from C[0m
              [1mCH3[0m

       A length in inches may be specified to  override  the  default  length.
       Other  [4mpic[24m  commands  can be tacked on to the end of a bond command, to
       created dotted or dashed bonds or to specify a [1mto [22mplace.

   [1mRings[0m
       There are lots of rings, but only five‐ and six‐sided  rings  get  much
       support.   [1mring  [22mby  itself is a six‐sided ring; [1mbenzene [22mis the benzene
       ring with a circle inside.  [1maromatic [22mputs a circle  into  any  kind  of
       ring.

              [1mring [22m[[1mpointing [22m([1mup[22m|[1mright[22m|[1mleft[22m|[1mdown[22m)] [[1maromatic[22m] [[1mput Mol at [4m[22mn[24m]
                   [[1mdouble [4m[22mi[24m,[4mj[24m [4mk[24m,[4ml[24m ... [[4mpicstuff[24m]

       The vertices of a ring are numbered 1, 2,  ...  from  the  vertex  that
       points  in the natural compass direction.  So for a hexagonal ring with
       the point at the top, the top vertex is 1, while  if  the  ring  has  a
       point at the east side, that is vertex 1.  This is expressed as

              R1: ring pointing up
              R2: ring pointing right

       The ring vertices are named [1m.V1[22m, ..., [1m.V[4m[22mn[24m, with [1m.V1 [22min the pointing di‐
       rection.  So the corners of [1mR1 [22mare [1mR1.V1 [22m(the [4mtop[24m), [1mR1.V2[22m, [1mR1.V3[22m, [1mR1.V4[0m
       (the  [4mbottom[24m),  etc., whereas for [1mR2[22m, [1mR2.V1 [22mis the rightmost vertex and
       [1mR2.V4 [22mthe leftmost.  These vertex names are used for  connecting  bonds
       or other rings.  For example,

              R1: benzene pointing right
              R2: benzene pointing right with .V6 at R1.V2

       creates two benzene rings connected along a side.

       Interior  double  bonds  are  specified as [1mdouble [4m[22mn1[24m[1m,[4m[22mn2[24m [4mn3[24m[1m,[4m[22mn4[24m ...[1m; [22meach
       number pair adds an interior bond.  So the alternate form of a  benzene
       ring is

              [1mring double 1,2 3,4 5,6[0m

       Heterocycles  (rings  with something other than carbon at a vertex) are
       written as [1mput [4m[22mX[24m [1mat [4m[22mV[24m, as in

              [1mR: ring put N at 1 put O at 2[0m

       In this heterocycle, [1mR.N [22mand [1mR.O [22mbecome synonyms for [1mR.V1 [22mand [1mR.V2[22m.

       There are two five‐sided rings.  [1mring5 [22mis pentagonal with a  side  that
       matches the six‐sided ring; it has four natural directions.  A [1mflatring[0m
       is a five‐sided ring created by chopping one corner of a six‐sided ring
       so that it exactly matches the six‐sided rings.

       The description of a ring has to fit on a single line.

   [1mMoieties and strings[0m
       A  moiety  is  a  string of characters beginning with a capital letter,
       such as N(C2H5)2.  Numbers are converted to subscripts (unless they ap‐
       pear  to  be  fractional values, as in N2.5H).  The name of a moiety is
       determined from the moiety after special characters have been  stripped
       out: e.g., N(C2H5)2) has the name NC2H52.

       Moieties  can  be  specified in two kinds.  Normally a moiety is placed
       right after the last thing mentioned, separated  by  a  semicolon  sur‐
       rounded by spaces, e.g.,

              [1mB1: bond ; OH[0m

       Here the moiety is [1mOH[22m; it is set after a bond.

       As  the  second  kind a moiety can be positioned as the first word in a
       [4mpic[24m‐like command, e.g.,

              [1mCH3 at C + (0.5,0.5)[0m

       Here the moiety is [1mCH3[22m.  It is placed at a position relative  to  [1mC[22m,  a
       moiety used earlier in the chemical structure.

       So  moiety  names  can be specified as [4mchem[24m positions everywhere in the
       [4mchem[24m code.  Beneath their printing moieties are names for places.

       The moiety [1mBP [22mis special.  It is not printed but just serves as a  mark
       to be referred to in later [4mchem[24m commands.  For example,

              [1mbond ; BP[0m

       sets a mark at the end of the bond.  This can be used then for specify‐
       ing a place.  The name [1mBP [22mis derived  from  [4mbranch[24m  [4mpoint[24m  (i.e.,  line
       crossing).

       A string within double quotes [1m" [22mis interpreted as a part of a [4mchem[24m com‐
       mand.  It represents a string  that  should  be  printed  (without  the
       quotes).   Text within quotes [1m"[22m...[1m" [22mis treated more or less like a moi‐
       ety except that no changes are made to the quoted part.

   [1mNames[0m
       In the alkyl chain above, notice that the carbon atom [1mC [22mwas  used  both
       to draw something and as the name for a place.  A moiety always defines
       a name for a place;  you can use your own names for places instead, and
       indeed, for rings you will have to.  A name is just

              [4mName[24m[1m: [22m...

       [4mName[24m  is  often  the  name of a moiety like [1mCH3[22m, but it need not to be.
       Any name that begins with a capital letter and which contains only let‐
       ters and numbers is valid:

              [1mFirst: bond[0m
                     [1mbond 30 from First[0m

   [1mMiscellaneous[0m
       The specific construction

              [1mbond [22m... [1m; moiety[0m

       is equivalent to

              bond
              moiety

       Otherwise,  each item has to be on a separate line (and only one line).
       Note that there must be whitespace after the semicolon which  separates
       the commands.

       A  period character [1m. [22mor a single quote [1m' [22min the first column of a line
       signals a [4mtroff[24m command, which is copied through as‐is.

       A line whose first non‐blank character  is  a  hash  character  ([1m#[22m)  is
       treated as a comment and thus ignored.  However, hash characters within
       a word are kept.

       A line whose first word is [1mpic [22mis copied through as‐is after  the  word
       [1mpic [22mhas been removed.

       The command

              [1msize [4m[22mn[0m

       scales  the  diagram to make it look plausible at point size [4mn[24m (default
       is 10 point).

       Anything else is assumed to be [4mpic[24m code, which is copied through with a
       label.

       Since  [4mchem[24m is a [4mpic[24m preprocessor, it is possible to include [4mpic[24m state‐
       ments in the middle of a diagram to draw things  not  provided  for  by
       [4mchem[24m  itself.   Such  [4mpic[24m statements should be included in [4mchem[24m code by
       adding [1mpic [22mas the first word of this line for clarity.

       The following [4mpic[24m commands are accepted as [4mchem[24m  commands,  so  no  [1mpic[0m
       command word is needed:

              [1mdefine [22mStart the definition of [4mpic[24m macro within [4mchem[24m.

              [1m[      [22mStart a block composite.

              [1m]      [22mEnd a block composite.

              [1m{      [22mStart a macro definition block.

              [1m}      [22mEnd a macro definition block.

       The macro names from [1mdefine [22mstatements are stored and their call is ac‐
       cepted as a [4mchem[24m command as well.

   [1mWish list[0m
       This TODO list was collected by Brian Kernighan.

       Error checking is minimal; errors are usually detected and reported  in
       an oblique fashion by [4mpic[24m.

       There is no library or file inclusion mechanism, and there is no short‐
       hand for repetitive structures.

       The extension mechanism is to create [4mpic[24m macros, but these  are  tricky
       to get right and don’t have all the properties of built‐in objects.

       There  is  no  in‐line chemistry yet (e.g., analogous to the [1m$[22m...[1m$ [22mcon‐
       struct of [4meqn[24m).

       There is no way to control entry point for bonds on groups.  Normally a
       bond connects to the carbon atom if entering from the top or bottom and
       otherwise to the nearest corner.

       Bonds from substituted atoms on heterocycles do not join at the  proper
       place without adding a bit of [4mpic[24m.

       There is no decent primitive for brackets.

       Text (quoted strings) doesn’t work very well.

       A squiggle bond is needed.

[1mDescription[0m
       The GNU implementation of [4meqn[24m is part of the [4mgroff[24m(7) document  format‐
       ting  system.   [4meqn[24m  is a [4mtroff[24m(1) preprocessor that translates expres‐
       sions in its own language, embedded in [4mroff[24m(7) input files, into mathe‐
       matical  notation  typeset by [4mtroff[24m(1).  It copies each [4mfile[24m’s contents
       to the standard output stream, translating each [4mequation[24m between  lines
       starting  with  [1m.EQ  [22mand [1m.EN[22m, or within a pair of user‐specified delim‐
       iters.  Normally, [4meqn[24m is not executed directly by the user, but invoked
       by  specifying the [1m-e [22moption to [4mgroff[24m(1).  While GNU [4meqn[24m’s input syntax
       is highly compatible with AT&T [4meqn[24m, the output [4meqn[24m produces  cannot  be
       processed  by  AT&T  [4mtroff[24m; GNU [4mtroff[24m (or a [4mtroff[24m implementing relevant
       GNU extensions) must be used.  If no [4mfile[24m operands  are  given  on  the
       command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4meqn[24m reads the standard input stream.

       Unless  the  [1m-R  [22moption is used, [4meqn[24m searches for the file [4meqnrc[24m in the
       directories given with the [1m-M [22moption first, then  in  [4m/usr/share/groff/[0m
       [4msite-tmac[24m,  and  finally  in  the  standard macro directory [4m/usr/share/[0m
       [4mgroff/1.23.0/tmac[24m.  If it exists and is readable, [4meqn[24m processes it  be‐
       fore any input files.

       This  man  page primarily discusses the differences between GNU [4meqn[24m and
       AT&T [4meqn[24m.  Most of the new features of the GNU [4meqn[24m input  language  are
       based on TeX.  There are some references to the differences between TeX
       and GNU [4meqn[24m below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.

       Three points are worth special note.

       • GNU [4meqn[24m emits  Presentation  MathML  output  when  invoked  with  the
         “[1m-T MathML[22m” option.

       • GNU [4meqn[24m does not support terminal devices well, though it may suffice
         for simple inputs.

       • GNU [4meqn[24m sets the input token “[1m...[22m” as an ellipsis on the  text  base‐
         line,  not  the  three centered dots of AT&T [4meqn[24m.  Set an ellipsis on
         the math axis with the GNU extension macro [1mcdots[22m.

   [1mAnatomy of an equation[0m
       [4meqn[24m input consists of tokens.  Consider a form of Newton’s  second  law
       of motion.  The input

              .EQ
              F =
              m a
              .EN

       becomes  [4mF[24m=[4mma[24m.  Each of [1mF[22m, [1m=[22m, [1mm[22m, and [1ma [22mis a token.  Spaces and newlines
       are interchangeable; they separate tokens but do  not  break  lines  or
       produce space in the output.

       The  following  input  characters  not only separate tokens, but manage
       their grouping and spacing as well.

       [1m{ }    [22mBraces perform grouping.  Whereas “[1me sup a b[22m” expresses  “([4me[24m  to
              the  [4ma[24m)  times [4mb[24m”, “[1me sup { a b }[22m” means “[4me[24m to the ([4ma[24m times [4mb[24m)”.
              When immediately preceded by a “[1mleft[22m” or  “[1mright[22m”  primitive,  a
              brace loses its special meaning.

       [1m^ ~    [22mare  the  [4mhalf[24m  [4mspace[24m and [4mfull[24m [4mspace,[24m respectively.  Use them to
              tune the appearance of the output.

       Tab and leader characters separate tokens  as  well  as  advancing  the
       drawing  position  to the next tab stop, but are seldom used in [4meqn[24m in‐
       put.  When they occur, they must appear at the outermost lexical scope.
       This roughly means that they can’t appear within braces that are neces‐
       sary to disambiguate the input; [4meqn[24m will  diagnose  an  error  in  this
       event.   (See subsection “Macros” below for additional token separation
       rules.)

       Other tokens are primitives, macros, an argument to either of the fore‐
       going, or components of an equation.

       [4mPrimitives[24m are fundamental keywords of the [4meqn[24m language.  They can con‐
       figure an aspect  of  the  preprocessor’s  state,  as  when  setting  a
       “global” font selection or type size ([1mgfont [22mand [1mgsize[22m), or declaring or
       deleting macros (“[1mdefine[22m” and [1mundef[22m); these are termed [4mcommands.[24m  Other
       primitives  perform  formatting operations on the tokens after them (as
       with [1mfat[22m, [1mover[22m, [1msqrt[22m, or [1mup[22m).

       Equation [4mcomponents[24m include mathematical variables, constants,  numeric
       literals,  and operators.  [4meqn[24m remaps some input character sequences to
       [4mgroff[24m special character escape sequences for economy in equation  entry
       and  to  ensure  that  glyphs  from  an  unstyled  font  are  used; see
       [4mgroff_char[24m(7).

              +   \[pl]                '    \[fm]
              ‐   \[mi]                <=   \[<=]
              =   \[eq]                >=   \[>=]

       [4mMacros[24m permit primitives, components, and other macros to be  collected
       and  referred  to by a single token.  Predefined macros make convenient
       the preparation of [4meqn[24m input in a form resembling  its  spoken  expres‐
       sion; for example, consider [1mcos[22m, [1mhat[22m, [1minf[22m, and [1mlim[22m.

   [1mSpacing and typeface[0m
       GNU  [4meqn[24m  imputes types to the components of an equation, adjusting the
       spacing between them accordingly.  Recognized  types  are  as  follows;
       most  affect  spacing  only, whereas the “[1mletter[22m” subtype of “[1mordinary[22m”
       also assigns a style.

         ordinary      character such as “1”, “a”, or “!”
           letter      character to be italicized by default
           digit       [4mn/a[0m
         operator      large operator such as “Σ”
         binary        binary operator such as “+”
         relation      relational operator such as “=”
         opening       opening bracket such as “(”
         closing       closing bracket such as “)”
         punctuation   punctuation character such as “,”
         inner         sub‐formula contained within brackets
         suppress      component to which automatic spacing is not applied

       Two primitives apply types to equation components.

       [1mtype [4m[22mt[24m [4me[0m
              Apply type [4mt[24m to expression [4me[24m.

       [4meqn[24m sets up spacings and styles as if by the following commands.

       [4meqn[24m assigns all other ordinary and special [4mroff[24m  characters,  including
       numerals  0–9, the “[1mordinary[22m” type.  (The “[1mdigit[22m” type is not used, but
       is available for customization.)  In keeping with  common  practice  in
       mathematical  typesetting,  lowercase, but not uppercase, Greek letters
       are assigned the “[1mletter[22m” type to style them in  italics.   The  macros
       for producing ellipses, “[1m...[22m”, [1mcdots[22m, and [1mldots[22m, use the “[1minner[22m” type.

   [1mNew primitives[0m
       The GNU extension primitives “[1mtype[22m” and [1mchartype [22mare discussed in  sub‐
       section  “Spacing  and typeface” above; “[1mset[22m” in subsection “Customiza‐
       tion” below; and [1mgrfont [22mand [1mgbfont [22min subsection “Fonts” below.  In the
       following synopses, [4mX[24m can be any character not appearing in the parame‐
       ter thus bracketed.

       [4me1[24m [1maccent [4m[22me2[0m
              Set [4me2[24m as an accent over [4me1[24m.  [4me2[24m is assumed to be at the  appro‐
              priate  height  for a lowercase letter without an ascender;  [4meqn[0m
              vertically shifts it depending on [4me1[24m’s height.  For example, [1mhat[0m
              is defined as follows.

                     accent { "^" }

              [1mdotdot[22m,  [1mdot[22m,  [1mtilde[22m,  [1mvec[22m,  and [1mdyad [22mare also defined using the
              [1maccent [22mprimitive.

              are  intended.  In [4mtroff[24m output, the type size is increased by 5
              scaled points.  MathML output emits the following.

                     <mstyle mathsize='big'>

       [1mcopy [4m[22mfile[0m

              [1m.EQ [22mor [1m.EN[22m.  If a relative path name, [4mfile[24m is sought relative to
              the current working directory.

       [1mifdef [4m[22mname[24m [4mX[24m [4manything[24m [4mX[0m
              If [4mname[24m is defined as a primitive or macro, interpret [4manything[24m.

       [1mnosplit [4m[22mtext[0m
              As "[4mtext[24m", but since [4mtext[24m is not quoted it is subject  to  macro
              expansion; it is not split up and the spacing between characters
              not adjusted per subsection “Spacing and typeface” above.

       [4me[24m [1mopprime[0m
              As [1mprime[22m, but set the prime symbol as an operator on [4me[24m.  In  the
              input  “[1mA opprime sub 1[22m”, the “1” is tucked under the prime as a
              subscript to the “A” (as is conventional in  mathematical  type‐
              setting),  whereas when [1mprime [22mis used, the “1” is a subscript to
              the prime character.  The precedence of [1mopprime [22mis the  same  as
              that  of  [1mbar  [22mand “[1munder[22m”, and higher than that of other primi‐
              tives except [1maccent [22mand [1muaccent[22m.  In unquoted  text,  a  neutral
              apostrophe ([1m'[22m) that is not the first character on the input line
              is treated like [1mopprime[22m.

       [1msdefine [4m[22mname[24m [4mX[24m [4manything[24m [4mX[0m
              As “[1mdefine[22m”, but [4mname[24m is not recognized as  a  macro  if  called
              with arguments.

       [4me1[24m [1msmallover [4m[22me2[0m
              As  [1mover[22m,  but reduces the type size of [4me1[24m and [4me2[24m, and puts less
              vertical space between [4me1[24m and [4me2[24m and the fraction bar.  The [1mover[0m
              primitive  corresponds  to  the TeX [1m\over [22mprimitive in displayed
              equation styles; [1msmallover [22mcorresponds to [1m\over  [22min  non‐display
              (“inline”) styles.

       [1mspace [4m[22mn[0m
              Set  extra  vertical  spacing around the equation, replacing the
              default values, where [4mn[24m is an integer in hundredths  of  an  em.
              If  positive,  [4mn[24m increases vertical spacing before the equation;
              if negative, it does so after the equation.  This primitive pro‐
              vides  an  interface to [4mgroff[24m’s [1m\x [22mescape sequence, but with the
              opposite sign convention.  It has no effect if the  equation  is
              part of a [4mpic[24m(1) picture.

       [1mspecial [4m[22mtroff‐macro[24m [4me[0m
              Construct  an  object  by  calling  [4mtroff‐macro[24m on [4me[24m.  The [4mtroff[0m
              string [1m0s [22mcontains the [4meqn[24m output for [4me[24m, and the  registers  [1m0w[22m,
              [1m0h[22m,  [1m0d[22m,  [1m0skern[22m,  and [1m0skew [22mthe width, height, depth, subscript
              kern, and skew of [4me[24m, respectively.  (The [4msubscript[24m  [4mkern[24m  of  an
              object  indicates  how much a subscript on that object should be
              “tucked in”, or placed to the left relative to a non‐subscripted
              glyph of the same size.  The [4mskew[24m of an object is how far to the
              right of the center of the object an accent over  it  should  be
              placed.)   The  macro  must modify [1m0s [22mso that it outputs the de‐
              sired result, returns the drawing position to the text  baseline
              at  the  beginning  of [4me[24m, and updates the foregoing registers to
              correspond to the new dimensions of the result.

              Suppose you want a construct that  “cancels”  an  expression  by
              drawing a diagonal line through it.

              As [4mtext[24m, but since [4mtext[24m is quoted, it is not  subject  to  macro
              expansion; it is split up and the spacing between characters ad‐
              justed per subsection “Spacing and typeface” above.

              Set [4me2[24m as an accent under [4me1[24m.  [4me2[24m is assumed to be at the appro‐
              priate  height for a letter without a descender;  [4meqn[24m vertically
              shifts it depending on whether [4me1[24m has a  descender.   [1mutilde  [22mis

              Remove  definition  of  macro or primitive [4mname[24m, making it unde‐
              fined.

              Vertically center [4me[24m about the [4mmath[24m [4maxis[24m, a horizontal line  upon
              which  fraction  bars  and  characters  such  as “+” and “−” are
              aligned.  MathML already behaves this way, so [4meqn[24m  ignores  this
              primitive  when  producing that output format.  The built‐in [1msum[0m
              macro is defined as if by the following.

   [1mExtended primitives[0m
       GNU [4meqn[24m extends the syntax of some AT&T [4meqn[24m primitives, introducing one
       deliberate incompatibility.

       [1mdelim on[0m
              [4meqn[24m  recognizes  an  “[1mon[22m”  argument  to the [1mdelim [22mprimitive spe‐
              cially, restoring any delimiters previously disabled with “[1mdelim[0m
              [1moff[22m”.  If delimiters haven’t been specified, neither command has
              effect.  Few [4meqn[24m documents are expected to use “o”  and  “n”  as
              left  and  right  delimiters, respectively.  If yours does, con‐
              sider swapping them, or select others.

              The integer value [4mn[24m (in hundredths of an em) increases the  ver‐
              tical  spacing  between  rows,  using [4mgroff[24m’s [1m\x [22mescape sequence
              (the value has no effect in MathML mode).  Negative  values  are
              accepted but have no effect.  If more than one [4mn[24m occurs in a ma‐

   [1mCustomization[0m
       When [4meqn[24m generates [4mtroff[24m input, the appearance  of  equations  is  con‐
       trolled by a large number of parameters.  They have no effect when gen‐
       erating MathML, which delegates typesetting to a MathML  rendering  en‐
       gine.  Configure these parameters with the [1mset [22mprimitive.

              assigns  parameter  [4mp[24m  the  integer value [4mn[24m; [4mn[24m is interpreted in
              units of hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated.  For exam‐

              parentheses.   We  intend  these  descriptions  to be expository
              rather than rigorous.

   [1mMacros[0m
       In  GNU  [4meqn[24m,  macros can take arguments.  A word defined by any of the
       [1mdefine[22m, [1mndefine[22m, or [1mtdefine [22mprimitives followed immediately by  a  left
       parenthesis is treated as a [4mparameterized[24m [4mmacro[24m [4mcall:[24m subsequent tokens
       up to a matching right parenthesis are treated as comma‐separated argu‐
       ments.   In this context only, commas and parentheses also serve as to‐
       ken separators.  A macro argument is not terminated by a  comma  inside
       parentheses  nested  within  it.  In a macro definition, [1m$[4m[22mn[24m, where [4mn[24m is
       between 1 and 9 inclusive, is replaced by the [4mn[24mth  argument;  if  there
       are fewer than [4mn[24m arguments, it is replaced by nothing.

       GNU [4meqn[24m further defines the macros [1mcdot[22m, [1mcdots[22m, and  [1mutilde  [22m(all  dis‐

       an ellipsis on the text baseline.

   [1mFonts[0m
       [4meqn[24m uses up to three typefaces to set an  equation:  italic  (oblique),
       roman (upright), and bold.  Assign each a [4mgroff[24m typeface with the prim‐
       itives [1mgfont[22m, [1mgrfont[22m, and [1mgbfont.  [22mThe defaults are the  styles  [1mI[22m,  [1mR[22m,
       and  [1mB  [22m(applied  to  the current font family).  The [1mchartype [22mprimitive
       (see above) sets a character’s type, which determines the face used  to
       set  it.  The “[1mletter[22m” type is set in italics; others are set in roman.
       Use the [1mbold [22mprimitive to select an (upright) bold style.

       [1mgbfont [4m[22mf[0m

              to  provide definitions appropriate for the device.  However, if
              the specified driver is “MathML”, the output  is  MathML  markup
              rather  than  [4mtroff[24m  input, and [4meqnrc[24m is not loaded at all.  The
              default output device is [1mps[22m.

[1mMathML mode limitations[0m
       MathML is designed on the assumption that  it  cannot  know  the  exact
       physical  characteristics  of the media and devices on which it will be
       rendered.  It does not support control of motions and sizes to the same
       degree [4mtroff[24m does.

       • [4meqn[24m customization parameters have no effect on generated MathML.

       • The  [1mspecial[22m,  [1mup[22m,  [1mdown[22m,  [1mfwd[22m,  and [1mback [22mprimitives cannot be imple‐
         mented, and yield a MathML “<merror>” message instead.

       • The [1mvcenter [22mprimitive is silently ignored, as centering on  the  math
         axis is the MathML default.

       • Characters  that [4meqn[24m sets extra large in [4mtroff[24m mode—notably the inte‐
         gral sign—may appear too small and  need  to  have  their  “<mstyle>”
         wrappers adjusted by hand.

       As  in its [4mtroff[24m mode, [4meqn[24m in MathML mode leaves the [1m.EQ [22mand [1m.EN [22mtokens
       in place, but emits nothing corresponding to  [1mdelim  [22mdelimiters.   They
       can,  however,  be  recognized  as  character sequences that begin with
       “<math>”, end with “</math>”, and do not cross line boundaries.

[1mCaveats[0m
       Tokens must be double‐quoted in [4meqn[24m input if they are not to be  recog‐
       nized  as  names  of  macros or primitives, or if they are to be inter‐
       preted by [4mtroff[24m.  In particular, short ones, like “[1mpi[22m”  and  “[1mPI[22m”,  can
       collide  with  [4mtroff[24m identifiers.  For instance, the [4meqn[24m command “[1mgfont[0m
       [1mPI[22m” does not select [4mgroff[24m’s Palatino italic font for the global  italic
       face; you must use “[1mgfont "PI"[22m” instead.

       Delimited  equations  are set at the type size current at the beginning
       of the input line, not necessarily that immediately preceding the open‐
       ing delimiter.

       Unlike  TeX,  [4meqn[24m  does not inherently distinguish displayed and inline
       equation styles; see the [1msmallover  [22mprimitive  above.   However,  macro
       packages  frequently  define  [1mEQ  [22mand  [1mEN [22mmacros such that the equation
       within is displayed.  These macros may accept arguments permitting  the
       equation to be labeled or captioned; see the package’s documentation.

[1mBugs[0m
       [4meqn[24m  abuses  terminology—its  “equations” can be inequalities, bare ex‐
       pressions, or unintelligible gibberish.  But  there’s  no  changing  it
       now.

       In [4mnroff[24m mode, lowercase Greek letters are rendered in roman instead of
       italic style.

       In MathML mode, the [1mmark [22mand [1mlineup [22mfeatures don’t work.  These  could,
       in theory, be implemented with “<maligngroup>” elements.

       In  MathML  mode, each digit of a numeric literal gets a separate “<mn>
       </mn>” pair, and decimal points are tagged with “<mo></mo>”.   This  is
       allowed by the specification, but inefficient.

[1mExamples[0m
       We first illustrate [4meqn[24m usage with a trigonometric identity.

              .EQ
              sin ( alpha + beta ) = sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta
              .EN

       It  can be convenient to set up delimiters if mathematical content will
       appear frequently in running text.

              .EQ
              delim $$
              .EN
              Having cached a table of logarithms,
              the property $ln ( x y ) = ln x + ln y$ sped calculations.

       The quadratic formula illustrates use of fractions  and  radicals,  and
       affords an opportunity to use the full space token [1m~[22m.

              .EQ
              x = { - b ~ \[+-] ~ sqrt { b sup 2 - 4 a c } } over { 2 a }
              .EN

       Alternatively,  we  could define the plus‐minus sign as a binary opera‐
       tor.  Automatic spacing puts 0.06 em less space on either side  of  the
       plus‐minus than ~ does, this being the difference between the widths of
       the [1mmedium_space [22mparameter used by binary operators  and  that  of  the
       full  space.   Independently,  we can define a macro “frac” for setting
       fractions.

              .EQ
              chartype "binary" \[+-]
              define frac ! { $1 } over { $2 } !
              x = frac(- b \[+-] sqrt { b sup 2 - 4 a c }, 2 a)
              .EN

       the standard output stream.  “[1m-[22m” cannot be both  an  input  and  output

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mglilypond[24m is a [4mgroff[24m(7) preprocessor  that  enables  the  embedding  of
       LilyPond music scores in [4mgroff[24m documents.  If no operands are given, or
       if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mglilypond[24m reads the standard input stream.   A  double‐
       dash  argument (“[1m--[22m”) causes all subsequent arguments to be interpreted
       as [4mfile[24m operands, even if their names start with a dash.

[1mUsage[0m
       At present, [4mglilypond[24m works with the [4mgroff[24m [1mps[22m, [1mdvi[22m, [1mhtml[22m, and [1mxhtml [22mde‐

   [1mOptions for building EPS files[0m
       [1m--ly2eps[0m
              Direct  [4mlilypond[24m(1)  to  create  Encapsulated  PostScript  (EPS)
              files.  This is the default.

       [1m--pdf2eps[0m
              The program [4mglilypond[24m generates a PDF file using [4mlilypond[24m.  Then
              the EPS file is generated by [4mpdf2ps[24m and [4mps2eps[24m.

   [1mDirectories and files[0m
       [1m-e[22m|[1m--eps_dir [4m[22mdirectory_name[0m
              Normally all [4mEPS[24m files are  sent  to  the  temporary  directory.
              With  this option, you can generate your own directory, in which
              all useful [4mEPS[24m files are send.  So at last, the temporary direc‐
              tory can be removed.

       [1m-p[22m|[1m--prefix [4m[22mbegin_of_name[0m
              Normally all temporary files get names that start with the [1mly[4m[22m...[0m
              prefix.  With this option, you can freely change this prefix.

       [1m-k[22m|[1m--keep_all[0m
              Normally all temporary files without the [4meps[24m files are  deleted.
              With  this  option,  all  generated files either by the [4mlilypond[0m
              program or other format transposers are kept.

       [1m-t[22m|[1m--temp_dir [4m[22mdir[0m
              With this option, you call a directory that is the base for  the
              temporary  directory.  This directory name is used as is without
              any extensions.  If this directory does not exist it is be  cre‐
              ated.  The temporary directory is created by Perl’s security op‐
              erations directly under this directory.  In this  temporary  di‐
              rectory, the temporary files are stored.

   [1mOutput[0m
       [1m-o[22m|[1m--output [4m[22mfile_name[0m
              Normally  all  [4mgroff[24m  output  of this program is sent to [1mSTDOUT[22m.
              With this option, that can be changed, such that the  output  is
              stored into a file named in the option argument [4mfile_name[24m.

       [1m-v[22m|[1m-V[22m|[1m--verbose[0m
              A lot more of information is sent to STDERR.

   [1mShort option collections[0m
       The argument handling of options

       [4mShort[24m  [4moptions[24m  are arguments that start with a single dash [1m-[22m.  Such an
       argument can consist of arbitrary many options without option argument,
       composed  as  a  collection  of  option characters following the single
       dash.

       Such a collection can be terminated by an option character that expects
       an option argument.  If this option character is not the last character
       of the argument, the following final part of the argument is the option
       argument.   If it is the last character of the argument, the next argu‐
       ment is taken as the option argument.

       This is the standard for [4mPOSIX[24m and [4mGNU[24m option management.

       For example,

       [1m-kVe [4m[22msome_dir[0m
              is a collection of the short options [1m-k [22mand  [1m-V  [22mwithout  option
              argument,  followed  by the short option [1m-e [22mwith option argument
              that is the following part of the argument  [4msome_dir[24m.   So  this
              argument  could  also  be  written as several arguments [1m-k -V -e[0m
              [4msome_dir[24m.

   [1mHandling of long options[0m
       Arguments that start with a double dash [1m-- [22mare so‐called [4mlong[24m [4moptions[24m [4mR[0m
       [4m.[24m  Each double dash argument can only have a single long option.

       [4mLong[24m  [4moptions[24m  have or have not an option argument.  An option argument
       can be the next argument or can be appended with an equal sign [1m= [22mto the
       same argument as the long option.

       [1m--help [22mis a long option without an option argument.

       [1m--eps_dir [4m[22msome_dir[0m
       [1m--eps_dir=[4m[22msome_dir[0m
              is the long option [1m--eps_dir [22mwith the option argument [4msome_dir[24m.

       Moreover  the  program allows abbreviations of long options, as much as
       possible.

       The [4mlong[24m [4moption[24m [1m--keep_all [22mcan be abbreviated from [1m--keep_al [22mup to  [1m--k[0m
       because the program does not have another [4mlong[24m [4moption[24m whose name starts
       with the character [1mk[22m.

       On the other hand, the option [1m--version [22mcannot be  abbreviated  further
       than [1m--vers [22mbecause there is also the [4mlong[24m [4moption[24m [1m--verbose [22mthat can be
       abbreviated up to [1m--verb[22m.

       An option argument can also be appended  to  an  abbreviation.   So  is
       [1m--e=[4m[22msome_dir[24m the same as [1m--eps_dir [4m[22msome_dir[24m.

       Moreover  the program allows an arbitrary usage of upper and lower case
       in the option name.  This is [4mPerl[24m style.

       For example, the [4mlong[24m [4moption[24m [1m--keep_all  [22mcan  as  well  be  written  as
       [1m--Keep_All [22mor even as an abbreviation like [1m--KeE[22m.

[1mLilyPond regions in [4mroff[24m input[0m
   [1mIntegrated LilyPond code[0m
       A [4mlilypond[24m part within a structure written in the [4mgroff[24m language is the
       whole part between the marks
              [1m.lilypond start[0m
       and
              [1m.lilypond end[0m
       A [4mgroff[24m input can have several of these [4mlilypond[24m parts.

       When processing such a [4mlilypond[24m part between [1m.lilypond start [22mand [1m.lily‐[0m
       [1mpond end [22mwe say that the [1mglilypond [22mprogram is in [4mlilypond[24m [4mmode[24m.

       These  [4mlilypond[24m  parts  are sent into temporary [4mlilypond[24m files with the
       file name extension [1m.ly[22m.  These files are transformed later on into [4mEPS[0m
       files.

   [1mInclusion of [4m.ly[24m files[0m
       An  additional  command  line  for  file inclusion of [4mlilypond[24m files is
       given by
       [1m.lilypond include [4m[22mfile_name[0m
       in [4mgroff[24m input.  For each such [4minclude[24m command, one  file  of  [4mlilypond[0m
       code  can  be  included into the [4mgroff[24m code.  Arbitrarily many of these
       commands can be included in the [4mgroff[24m input.

       These include commands can only be used  outside  the  [4mlilypond[24m  parts.
       Within the [4mlilypond[24m [4mmode[24m, this inclusion is not possible.  So [1m.lilypond[0m
       [1minclude [22mmay not be used in [4mlilypond[24m [4mmode[24m, i.e. between [1m.lilypond  start[0m
       and  [1m.lilypond  end[22m.  These included [4mly[24m‐files are also transformed into
       [4mEPS[24m files.

[1mGenerated files[0m
       By the transformation process of [4mlilypond[24m parts into [4mEPS[24m  files,  there
       are many files generated.  By default, these files are regarded as tem‐
       porary files and as such stored in a temporary directory.

       This process can be changed by command‐line options.

   [1mCommand‐line options for directories[0m
       The temporary directory for this program is  either  created  automati‐
       cally or can be named by the option [1m-t[22m|[1m--temp_dir [4m[22mdir[24m.

       Moreover, the [4mEPS[24m files that are later on referred by [1m.PSPIC [22mcommand in
       the final [4mgroff[24m output can be stored in a different directory that  can
       be  set  by  the command‐line option [1m-e[22m|[1m--eps_dir [4m[22mdirectory_name[24m.  With
       this option, the temporary directory can be removed completely  at  the
       end of the program.

       The  beginning  of  the  names of the temporary files can be set by the
       command‐line options [1m-p [22mor [1m--prefix[22m.

       All of the temporary files except the [4mEPS[24m files  are  deleted  finally.
       This  can  be  changed  by  setting  the  command‐line  options  [1m-k  [22mor
       [1m--keep_files[22m.  With this, all temporary files and directories are kept,
       not deleted.

       These  [4mEPS[24m  files are stored in a temporary or [4mEPS[24m directory.  But they
       cannot be deleted by the transformation process because they are needed
       for the display which can take a long time.

[1mTransformation processes for generating EPS files[0m
   [1mMode pdf2eps[0m
       This  mode  is  the actual default and can also be chosen by the option
       [1m--pdf2eps[22m.

       In this mode, the [1m.ly [22mfiles are transformed by the [4mlilypond[24m(1)  program
       into [4mPDF[24m files, using
              [1mlilypond --pdf --output=[4m[22mfile‐name[0m
       for  each  [1m.ly [22mfile.  The [4mfile‐name[24m must be provided without the exten‐
       sion [1m.pdf[22m.  By this process, a file [4mfile‐name[24m[1m.pdf [22mis generated.

       The next step is to transform these [4mPDF[24m files into a [4mPS[24m file.  This  is
       done by the [4mpdf2ps[24m(1) program using
              $ [1mpdf2ps [4m[22mfile‐name[24m[1m.pdf [4m[22mfile‐name[24m[1m.pds[0m
       The  next  step  creates an [4mEPS[24m file from the [4mPS[24m file.  This is done by
       the [4mps2eps[24m(1) program using
              $ [1mps2eps [4m[22mfile‐name[24m[1m.ps[0m

       By that, a file [4mfile‐name[24m[1m.eps [22mis created for each [4mlilypond[24m part in  the
       [4mgroff[24m file or standard input.

       The  last  step to be done is replacing all [4mlilypond[24m parts by the [4mgroff[0m
       command
              [1m.PSPIC [4m[22mfile‐name[24m[1m.eps[0m

   [1mMode ly2eps[0m
       In earlier time, this mode was the default.  But now it does  not  work
       any  more,  so  accept the new default [4mpdf2eps[24m.  For testing, this mode
       can also be chosen by the [4mglilypond[24m option [1m--ly2eps[22m.

       In this mode, the [1m.ly [22mfiles are transformed  by  the  [4mlilypond[24m  program
       into many files of different formats, including [4meps[24m files, using

[1mDescription[0m
       This is a preprocessor for [4mgroff[24m(1).  It allows the use of [4mperl[24m(7) code
       in  [4mgroff[24m(7)  files.   The result of a [4mPerl[24m [4mpart[24m can be stored in groff

       If  no  operands are given, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mgperl[24m reads the standard
       input stream.  A double‐dash argument (“[1m--[22m”) causes all subsequent  ar‐
       guments  to  be interpreted as [4mfile[24m operands, even if their names start
       with a dash.  [1m-h [22mand [1m--help [22mdisplay a usage  message,  whereas  [1m-v  [22mand

[1mPerl regions[0m
       [4mPerl[24m  parts in [4mgroff[24m [4mfiles[24m are enclosed by two [1m.Perl [22mrequests with dif‐
       ferent arguments, a [4mstarting[24m and an [4mending[24m command.

   [1mStarting Perl mode[0m
       The starting [4mPerl[24m [4mrequest[24m can either be without arguments, or by a  re‐
       quest that has the term [1mstart [22mas its only argument.

              •      [1m.Perl[0m

              •      [1m.Perl start[0m

   [1mEnding Perl mode without storage[0m
       A  [1m.Perl  [22mcommand line with an argument different from [1mstart [22mfinishes a
       running [4mPerl[24m [4mpart[24m.  Of course, it would be reasonable to add the  argu‐
       ment [1mstop[22m; that’s possible, but not necessary.

              •      [1m.Perl stop[0m

              •      [1m.Perl [4m[22mother_than_start[0m
       The  argument  [4mother_than_start[24m  can  additionally  be  used as a [4mgroff[0m
       string variable name for storage — see next section.

   [1mEnding Perl mode with storage[0m
       A useful feature of [4mgperl[24m is to store one or more results from the [4mPerl[0m
       [4mmode[24m.

       The output of a [4mPerl[24m [4mpart[24m can be got with backticks [1m`...`[22m.

       This  program  collects all printing to STDOUT (normal standard output)
       by the Perl [1mprint [22mprogram.  This pseudo‐printing output can  have  sev‐
       eral lines, due to printed line breaks with [1m\n[22m.  By that, the output of
       a Perl run should be stored into a Perl array, with a single  line  for
       each array member.

       This Perl array output can be stored by [4mgperl[24m in either

       [4mgroff[24m [4mstrings[0m
              by creating a groff command [1m.ds[0m

       [4mgroff[24m [4mregister[0m
              by creating a groff command [1m.rn[0m

       The  storage  modes  can be determined by arguments of a final stopping
       [1m.Perl [22mcommand.  Each argument [1m.ds [22mchanges the mode  into  [4mgroff[24m  [4mstring[0m
       and  [1m.nr  [22mchanges the mode into [4mgroff[24m [4mregister[24m for all following output
       parts.

       By default, all output is saved as strings, so [1m.ds [22mis not really needed
       before  the  first  [1m.nr [22mcommand.  That suits to [4mgroff[24m(7), because every
       output can be saved as [4mgroff[24m string, but the registers can be very  re‐
       strictive.

       In [4mstring[24m [4mmode[24m, [4mgperl[24m generates a [4mgroff[24m [4mstring[24m storage line
              [1m.ds [4m[22mvar_name[24m [4mcontent[0m
       In [4mregister[24m [4mmode[24m the following groff command is generated
              [1m.nr [4m[22mvar_name[24m [4mcontent[0m

       We present argument collections in the following.  You can add as first
       argument for all [1mstop[22m.  We omit this additional element.

       [1m.Perl .ds [4m[22mvar_name[0m
              This will store 1  output  line  into  the  groff  string  named
              [4mvar_name[24m by the automatically created command
                     [1m.ds [4m[22mvar_name[24m [4moutput[0m

       [1m.Perl [4m[22mvar_name[0m
              If  [4mvar_name[24m  is  different from [1mstart [22mthis is equivalent to the
              former command, because the string mode is string with [1m.ds  [22mcom‐
              mand.  default.

       [1m.Perl [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [4mvar_name2[0m
              This will store 2 output lines into groff string names [4mvar_name1[0m
              and [4mvar_name2[24m, because the default mode [1m.ds [22mis active, such that
              no [1m.ds [22margument is needed.  Of course, this is equivalent to
                     [1m.Perl .ds [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [4mvar_name2[0m
              and
                     [1m.Perl .ds [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [1m.ds [4m[22mvar_name2[0m

       [1m.Perl .nr [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [4mvarname2[0m
              stores both variables as register variables.  [4mgperl[24m generates
              [1m.nr [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [4moutput_line1[0m
              [1m.nr [4m[22mvar_name2[24m [4moutput_line2[0m

       [1m.Perl .nr [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [1m.ds [4m[22mvar_name2[0m
              stores the 1st argument as [4mregister[24m and the second as [4mstring[24m by
              [1m.nr [4m[22mvar_name1[24m [4moutput_line1[0m
              [1m.ds [4m[22mvar_name2[24m [4moutput_line2[0m

[1mExample[0m
       A possible [4mPerl[24m [4mpart[24m in a [4mroff[24m [4mfile[24m could look like that:
              before
              .Perl start
              my $result = 'some data';
              print $result;
              .Perl stop .ds string_var
              after

       This  stores  the  result  [1m”some  data”  [22minto  the  [4mroff[24m  [4mstring[24m called
       [1mstring_var[22m, such that the following line is printed:
              .ds string_var some data
       by [4mgperl[24m as food for the coming [4mgroff[24m run.

       A [4mPerl[24m [4mpart[24m with several outputs is:
              .Perl start
              print ”first\n”;
              print ”second line\n”;
              print ”3\n”;
              .Perl var1 var2 .nr var3
       This stores 3 printed lines into 3 [4mgroff[24m strings.  [1mvar1[22m,[1mvar2[22m,[1mvar3[22m.   So
       the following [4mgroff[24m command lines are created:
              .ds var1 first
              .ds var2 second line
              .nr var3 3

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mgpinyin[24m  is  a  preprocessor for [4mgroff[24m(1) that facilitates use of Hanyu
       Pinyin in [4mgroff[24m(7) files.  Pinyin is a method for writing the  Mandarin
       Chinese  language  with  the Latin alphabet.  Mandarin consists of more
       than four hundred base syllables, each spoken with one of five  differ‐
       ent  tones.  Changing the tone applied to the syllable generally alters
       the meaning of the word it forms.  In Pinyin, a syllable is written  in
       the Latin alphabet and a numeric tone indicator can be appended to each
       syllable.

       Each [4minput‐file[24m is a file name or the character “[1m-[22m”  to  indicate  that
       the  standard input stream should be read.  As usual, the argument “[1m--[22m”
       can be used in order to force interpretation of all remaining arguments
       as  file  names,  even if an [4minput‐file[24m argument begins with a “[1m-[22m”.  [1m-h[0m
       and [1m--help [22mdisplay a usage message, while [1m-v [22mand [1m--version [22mshow version
       information; all exit afterward.

   [1mPinyin sections[0m
       Pinyin  sections  in  [4mgroff[24m  files are enclosed by two [1m.pinyin [22mrequests
       with different arguments.  The starting request is
              .pinyin start
       or
              .pinyin begin
       and the ending request is
              .pinyin stop
       or
              .pinyin end
       .

   [1mSyllables[0m
       In Pinyin, each syllable is represented by one  to  six  letters  drawn
       from  the  fifty‐two  upper‐ and lowercase letters of the Unicode basic
       Latin character set, plus the letter “U” with dieresis (umlaut) in both
       cases—in other words, the members of the set “[a–zA–ZüÜ]”.

       In [4mgroff[24m input, all basic Latin letters are written as themselves.  The
       “u with dieresis” can be written as “\[:u]” in lowercase or “\[:U]”  in
       uppercase.  Within [1m.pinyin [22msections, [4mgpinyin[24m supports the form “ue” for
       lowercase and the forms “Ue” and “UE” for uppercase.

   [1mTones[0m
       Each syllable has exactly one of five [4mtones[24m.  The fifth tone is not ex‐
       plicitly  written at all, but each of the first through fourth tones is
       indicated with a diacritic above a specific vowel within the syllable.

       In a [4mgpinyin[24m source file, these tones are written by adding  a  numeral
       in  the  range  0 to 5 after the syllable.  The tone numbers 1 to 4 are
       transformed into accents above vowels in the output.  The tone  numbers
       0 and 5 are synonymous.

       The tones are written as follows.

       Tone     Description      Diacritic   Example Input   Example Output
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       first    flat             ¯           ma1             mā
       second   rising           ´           ma2             má
       third    falling‐rising   ˇ           ma3             mǎ
       fourth   falling          `           ma4             mà
       fifth    neutral          (none)      ma0             ma
                                             ma5

       The  neutral tone number can be omitted from a word‐final syllable, but
       not otherwise.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mgrn[24m is a preprocessor for including [4mgremlin[24m pictures in [4mtroff[24m(1) input.
       [4mgrn[24m  writes to standard output, processing only input lines between two
       that start with [1m.GS [22mand [1m.GE[22m.  Those lines  must  contain  [4mgrn[24m  commands
       (see  below).  These macros request a [4mgremlin[24m file; the picture in that
       file is converted and placed in the [4mtroff[24m input  stream.   [1m.GS  [22mmay  be
       called  with  a  [1mC[22m, [1mL[22m, or [1mR [22margument to center, left‐, or right‐justify
       the whole [4mgremlin[24m picture (the default is to center).  If  no  [4mfile[24m  is
       mentioned,  the standard input is read.  At the end of the picture, the
       position on the page is the bottom of the [4mgremlin[24m picture.  If the  [4mgrn[0m
       entry is ended with [1m.GF [22minstead of [1m.GE[22m, the position is left at the top
       of the picture.

       Currently only the [4mme[24m macro package has support for [1m.GS[22m, [1m.GE[22m, and [1m.GF[22m.

       [4mgrn[24m produces drawing escape sequences that use [4mgroff[24m’s color scheme ex‐
       tension ([1m\D'F [22m...[1m'[22m), and thus may not work with other [4mtroff[24ms.

   [4m[1mgrn[24m commands[0m
       Each input line between [1m.GS [22mand [1m.GE [22mmay have one [4mgrn[24m command.  Commands
       consist of one or two strings  separated  by  white  space,  the  first
       string  being  the command and the second its operand.  Commands may be
       upper‐ or lowercase and abbreviated down to one character.

       Commands that affect  a  picture’s  environment  (those  listed  before
       “[1mdefault[22m”,  see  below) are only in effect for the current picture: the
       environment is reinitialized to the defaults at the start of  the  next
       picture.  The commands are as follows.

       [1m1 [4m[22mN[0m
       [1m2 [4m[22mN[0m
       [1m3 [4m[22mN[0m
       [1m4 [4m[22mN[24m    Set  [4mgremlin[24m’s text size number 1 (2, 3, or 4) to [4mN[24m points.  The
              default is 12 (16, 24, and 36, respectively).

       [1mroman [4m[22mf[0m
       [1mitalics [4m[22mf[0m
       [1mbold [4m[22mf[0m
       [1mspecial [4m[22mf[0m
              Set the roman (italics, bold, or special) font to [4mtroff[24m’s font [4mf[0m
              (either  a  name or number).  The default is R (I, B, and S, re‐
              spectively).

       [1ml [4m[22mf[0m
       [1mstipple [4m[22mf[0m
              Set the stipple font to [4mtroff[24m’s stipple font [4mf[24m (name or number).
              The  command  [1mstipple [22mmay be abbreviated down as far as “[1mst[22m” (to
              avoid confusion with “[1mspecial[22m”).  There is [4mno[24m default for  stip‐
              ples (unless one is set by the “[1mdefault[22m” command), and it is in‐
              valid to include a [4mgremlin[24m picture with polygons without  speci‐
              fying a stipple font.

       [1mx [4m[22mN[0m
       [1mscale [4m[22mN[0m
              Magnify  the  picture (in addition to any default magnification)
              by [4mN[24m, a floating‐point number larger  than  zero.   The  command
              [1mscale [22mmay be abbreviated down to “[1msc[22m”.

       [1mnarrow [4m[22mN[0m
       [1mmedium [4m[22mN[0m
       [1mthick [4m[22mN[0m
              Set the thickness of [4mgremlin[24m’s narrow (medium and thick, respec‐
              tively) lines to [4mN[24m times 0.15pt (this value can  be  changed  at
              compile  time).  The default is 1.0 (3.0 and 5.0, respectively),
              which corresponds to 0.15pt (0.45pt and  0.75pt,  respectively).
              A  thickness  value  of zero selects the smallest available line
              thickness.  Negative values cause the line thickness to be  pro‐
              portional to the current point size.

       [1mpointscale [22m[[1moff[22m|[1mon[22m]
              Scale  text  to  match  the  picture.   Gremlin  text is usually
              printed in the point size specified with the commands [1m1[22m,  [1m2[22m,  [1m3[22m,
              or [1m4[22m, regardless of any scaling factors in the picture.  Setting
              [1mpointscale [22mwill cause the point sizes to scale with the  picture
              (within [4mtroff[24m’s limitations, of course).  An operand of anything
              but [1moff [22mwill turn text scaling on.

       [1mdefault[0m
              Reset the picture environment defaults to the  settings  in  the
              current picture.  This is meant to be used as a global parameter
              setting mechanism at the beginning of the [4mtroff[24m input file,  but
              can be used at any time to reset the default settings.

       [1mwidth [4m[22mN[0m
              Force the picture to be [4mN[24m inches wide.  This overrides any scal‐
              ing factors present in the same picture.  “[1mwidth 0[22m” is ignored.

       [1mheight [4m[22mN[0m
              Force the picture to be [4mN[24m inches high, overriding other  scaling
              factors.   If  both  [1mwidth [22mand [1mheight [22mare specified, the tighter
              constraint will determine the scale of the picture.  [1mheight  [22mand
              [1mwidth  [22mcommands  are  not  saved with a “[1mdefault[22m” command.  They
              will, however, affect point size scaling if that option is set.

       [1mfile [4m[22mname[0m
              Get picture from [4mgremlin[24m file [4mname[24m located the current directory
              (or in the library directory; see the [1m-M [22moption above).  If mul‐
              tiple [1mfile [22mcommands are given, the last one controls.   If  [4mname[0m
              doesn’t  exist, an error message is reported and processing con‐
              tinues from the [1m.GE [22mline.

   [1mUsage with [4mgroff[0m
       Since [4mgrn[24m is a preprocessor, it has no access to elements of  formatter
       state, such as indentation, line length, type size, or register values.
       Consequently, no [4mtroff[24m input can be placed  between  the  [1m.GS  [22mand  [1m.GE[0m
       macros.   However,  [4mgremlin[24m text elements are subsequently processed by
       [4mtroff[24m, so anything valid in a single line of [4mtroff[24m input is valid in  a
       line  of [4mgremlin[24m text (barring the dot control character “.” at the be‐
       ginning of a line).  Thus, it is possible to have  equations  within  a
       [4mgremlin[24m  figure  by  including  in the [4mgremlin[24m file [4meqn[24m expressions en‐
       closed by previously defined delimiters (e.g., “$$”).

       When using [4mgrn[24m along with other preprocessors, it is best to run [4mtbl[24m(1)
       before  [4mgrn[24m,  [4mpic[24m(1),  and/or  [4mideal[24m  to avoid overworking [4mtbl[24m.  [4meqn[24m(1)
       should always be run last.  [4mgroff[24m(1) will automatically run  preproces‐
       sors in the correct order.

       A  picture  is  considered  an entity, but that doesn’t stop [4mtroff[24m from
       trying to break it up if it falls off the end of a page.   Placing  the
       picture between “keeps” in the [4mme[24m macros will ensure proper placement.

       [4mgrn[24m  uses  [4mtroff[24m’s registers [1mg1 [22mthrough [1mg9 [22mand sets registers [1mg1 [22mand [1mg2[0m
       to the width and height of the [4mgremlin[24m figure (in device units)  before
       entering  the  [1m.GS  [22mmacro  (this is for those who want to rewrite these
       macros).

   [1mGremlin file format[0m
       There exist two distinct [4mgremlin[24m file formats: the original format  for
       AED  graphic  terminals, and the Sun or X11 version.  An extension used
       by the Sun/X11 version allowing reference points with negative  coordi‐
       nates  is  [4mnot[24m  compatible  with the AED version.  As long as a [4mgremlin[0m
       file does not contain negative coordinates, either format will be  read
       correctly by either version of [4mgremlin[24m or [4mgrn[24m.  The other difference in
       Sun/X11 format is the use of names for picture objects (e.g.,  [1mPOLYGON[22m,
       [1mCURVE[22m)  instead  of  numbers.   Files representing the same picture are
       shown below.

       • The first line of each [4mgremlin[24m file contains either the string “[1mgrem‐[0m
         [1mlinfile[22m” (AED) or “[1msungremlinfile[22m” (Sun/X11).

       • The  second line of the file contains an orientation and [4mx[24m and [4my[24m val‐
         ues for a positioning point, separated by spaces.   The  orientation,
         either [1m0 [22mor [1m1[22m, is ignored by the Sun/X11 version.  [1m0 [22mmeans that [4mgrem‐[0m
         [4mlin[24m will display things in horizontal format (a  drawing  area  wider
         than  it  is tall, with a menu across the top).  [1m1 [22mmeans that [4mgremlin[0m
         will display things in vertical format (a drawing area taller than it
         is  wide,  with a menu on the left side).  [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are floating‐point
         values giving a positioning point to be used when this file  is  read
         into  another file.  The stuff on this line really isn’t all that im‐
         portant; a value of “[1m1 0.00 0.00[22m” is suggested.

       • The rest of the file consists of zero or more element specifications.
         After  the last element specification is a line containing the string
         “[1m-1[22m”.

       • Lines longer than 127 characters are truncated to that length.

   [1mElement specifications[0m
       • The first line of each element contains a single decimal number  giv‐
         ing the type of the element (AED) or its name (Sun/X11).

       • After the object type comes a variable number of lines, each specify‐
         ing a point used to display the element.  Each line contains an x‐co‐
         ordinate  and  a  y‐coordinate in floating‐point format, separated by
         spaces.  The list of points is terminated by a  line  containing  the
         string “[1m-1.0 -1.0[22m” (AED) or a single asterisk, “[1m*[22m” (Sun/X11).

       • After  the  points comes a line containing two decimal values, giving
         the brush and size for the element.  The brush determines  the  style
         in  which  things are drawn.  For vectors, arcs, and curves there are
         six valid brush values.

         For polygons, one more value, 0, is valid.  It  specifies  a  polygon
         with an invisible border.  For text, the brush selects a font as fol‐
         lows.

         If you’re using [4mgrn[24m to run your pictures through [4mgroff[24m, the  font  is
         really  just a starting font.  The text string can contain formatting
         sequences like “\fI” or “\d” which may change the font (as well as do
         many  other things).  For text, the size field is a decimal value be‐
         tween 1 and 4.  It selects the size of the font  in  which  the  text
         will  be  drawn.   For  polygons, this size field is interpreted as a
         stipple number to fill the polygon with.  The number is used to index
         into a stipple font at print time.

       • The  last line of each element contains a decimal number and a string
         of characters, separated by a single space.  The number is a count of
         the  number  of  characters  in the string.  This information is used
         only for text elements, and contains the text string.  There  can  be
         spaces inside the text.  For arcs, curves, and vectors, the character
         count is zero ([1m0[22m), followed by exactly one space before the newline.

   [1mCoordinates[0m
       [4mgremlin[24m was designed for AED terminals, and its coordinates reflect the
       AED  coordinate  space.   For  vertical pictures, [4mx[24m values range 116 to
       511, and [4my[24m values from 0 to 483.  For  horizontal  pictures,  [4mx[24m  values
       range  from 0 to 511, and [4my[24m values from 0 to 367.  Although you needn’t
       absolutely stick to this range, you’ll get better  results  if  you  at
       least  stay  in  this  vicinity.  Also, point lists are terminated by a
       point of (-1, -1), so you  shouldn’t  ever  use  negative  coordinates.
       [4mgremlin[24m writes out coordinates using the [4mprintf[24m(3) format “%f1.2”; it’s
       probably a good idea to use the same format if you want to  modify  the
       [4mgrn[24m code.

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m DVI output driver translates the output of [4mtroff[24m(1) into
       TeX DVI format.  Normally, [4mgrodvi[24m is invoked by [4mgroff[24m(1) when the  lat‐
       ter is given the “[1m-T dvi[22m” option.  (In this installation, [1mps [22mis the de‐
       fault output device.)  Use [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-P [22moption to pass any options  shown
       above  to  [4mgrodvi[24m.   If no [4mfile[24m arguments are given, or if [4mfile[24m is “-”,
       [4mgrodvi[24m reads the standard input stream.  Output is written to the stan‐
       dard output stream.

       The DVI file generated by [4mgrodvi[24m can interpreted by any correctly writ‐
       ten DVI driver.  [4mtroff[24m drawing primitives are  implemented  using  [4mtpic[0m
       version  2  specials.   If the driver does not support these, [1m\D [22mescape
       sequences will not produce any output.

       Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files can be  easily  included;  use  the
       [1mPSPIC  [22mmacro.   [4mpspic.tmac[24m  is  loaded  automatically by [4mdvi.tmac[24m.  See
       [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5).

       The default color used by the [1m\m [22mand  [1m\M  [22mescape  sequences  is  black.
       Currently,  the  stroke color for [1m\D [22mdrawing escape sequences is black;
       fill color values are translated to gray.

       In [4mgroff[24m, as in AT&T [4mtroff[24m, the [1m\N [22mescape sequence can be used  to  ac‐
       cess any glyph in the current font by its position in the corresponding
       TFM file.

       By design, the DVI format doesn’t care about the physical dimensions of
       the  output  medium.   Instead,  [4mgrodvi[24m  emits  the equivalent to TeX’s
       [1m\special{papersize=[4m[22mwidth[24m[1m,[4m[22mlength[24m[1m} [22mon the first page; [4mdvips[24m  (or  another
       DVI  driver)  then  sets the page size accordingly.  If either the page
       width or length is not positive, no [1mpapersize [22mspecial is output.

       A device control escape sequence [1m\X'[4m[22manything[24m[1m' [22mis translated to the same
       DVI  file  instructions  as  would be produced by [1m\special{[4m[22manything[24m[1m} [22min
       TeX; [4manything[24m cannot contain a newline.

   [1mTypefaces[0m
       [4mgrodvi[24m supports the standard four styles:  [1mR  [22m(roman),  [1mI  [22m([4mitalic[24m),  [1mB[0m
       ([1mbold[22m),  and [1mBI [22m([4m[1mbold‐italic[24m[22m).  Fonts are grouped into families [1mT [22mand [1mH[0m
       having members in each style.  “CM” abbreviates “Computer Modern”.

              [1mTR     [22mCM Roman (cmr10)
              [1mTI     [22mCM Text Italic (cmti10)
              [1mTB     [22mCM Bold Extended Roman (cmbx10)
              [1mTBI    [22mCM Bold Extended Text Italic (cmbxti10)
              [1mHR     [22mCM Sans Serif (cmss10)

              [1mHBI    [22mCM Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbxo10)

       The following fonts are not members of a family.

              [1mCW     [22mCM Typewriter Text (cmtt10)
              [1mCWI    [22mCM Italic Typewriter Text (cmitt10)

       Special fonts include [1mMI [22m(cmmi10), [1mS [22m(cmsy10),  [1mEX  [22m(cmex10),  [1mSC  [22m(cm‐
       tex10, only for [1mCW[22m), and, perhaps surprisingly, [1mTR[22m, [1mTI[22m, and [1mCW[22m, because
       TeX places some glyphs in text fonts that  [4mtroff[24m  generally  does  not.
       For italic fonts, [1mCWI [22mis used instead of [1mCW[22m.

       Finally,  the  symbol  fonts  of  the American Mathematical Society are
       available as special fonts [1mSA [22m(msam10) and [1mSB [22m(msbm10).  They  are  are
       not mounted by default.

       The  [4mtroff[24m  option  [1m-mec [22mloads the [4mec.tmac[24m macro file, employing the EC
       and TC fonts instead of CM.  These are designed similarly to  the  Com‐
       puter  Modern  fonts;  further,  they  provide Euro [1m\[Eu] [22mand per mille
       [1m\[%0] [22mglyphs.  [4mec.tmac[24m must  be  loaded  before  any  language‐specific
       macro  files  because  it does not set up the codes necessary for auto‐
       matic hyphenation.

   [1mFont description files[0m
       Use [4mtfmtodit[24m(1) to create [4mgroff[24m font description files  from  TFM  (TeX

       lowing additional directives, which [4mtfmtodit[24m generates automatically.

              ing  position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the drawing
              position +([4mdh[24m,[4mdv[24m), which becomes the new drawing position after‐
              ward.   This  command produces a rule in the DVI file and so can
              be printed even with a driver that does not  support  [4mtpic[24m  spe‐
              cials, unlike the other [1m\D [22mcommands.

[1mBugs[0m
       DVI  files  produced by [4mgrodvi[24m use a different resolution (57,816 units
       per inch) from those produced  by  TeX.   Incorrectly  written  drivers
       which  assume the resolution used by TeX, rather than using the resolu‐
       tion specified in the DVI file, will not work with [4mgrodvi[24m.

       When using the [1m-d [22moption with boxed  tables,  vertical  and  horizontal
       lines  can  sometimes  protrude by one pixel.  This is a consequence of
       the way TeX requires that the heights and widths of rules be rounded.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mgroff[24m is the primary front end to the GNU [4mroff[24m document formatting sys‐
       tem.   GNU  [4mroff[24m  is  a  typesetting system that reads plain text input
       files that include formatting commands to produce output in PostScript,
       PDF,  HTML,  DVI, or other formats, or for display to a terminal.  For‐
       matting commands can be low‐level typesetting primitives, macros from a
       supplied  package, or user‐defined macros.  All three approaches can be
       combined.  If no [4mfile[24m operands are specified, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”,  [4mgroff[0m
       reads the standard input stream.

       A  reimplementation  and  extension  of  the typesetter from AT&T Unix,
       [4mgroff[24m is present on most POSIX systems owing to  its  long  association
       with  Unix  manuals  (including man pages).  It and its predecessor are
       notable for their production of several best‐selling software engineer‐
       ing texts.  [4mgroff[24m is capable of producing typographically sophisticated
       documents while consuming minimal system resources.

       The [4mgroff[24m command orchestrates  the  execution  of  preprocessors,  the
       transformation  of  input  documents into a device‐independent page de‐
       scription language, and the production of output from that language.

[1mOptions[0m
       [1m-h [22mand [1m--help [22mdisplay a usage message and exit.

       Because [4mgroff[24m is intended to subsume most users’ direct invocations  of
       the  [4mtroff[24m(1) formatter, the two programs share a set of options.  How‐
       ever, [4mgroff[24m has some options that [4mtroff[24m  does  not  share,  and  others
       which  [4mgroff[24m  interprets  differently.  At the same time, not all valid
       [4mtroff[24m options can be given to [4mgroff[24m.

   [4m[1mgroff[24m‐specific options[0m
       The following options either do not exist in GNU [4mtroff[24m  or  are  inter‐
       preted differently by [4mgroff[24m.

       [1m-D [4m[22menc[24m Set  fallback  input encoding used by [4mpreconv[24m(1) to [4menc[24m; implies

       [1m-I [4m[22mdir[24m Works as [4mtroff[24m’s option (see below), but also implies [1m-g [22mand [1m-s[22m.
              It  is  passed  to  [4msoelim[24m(1)  and the output driver, and [4mgrn[24m is
              passed an [1m-M [22moption with [4mdir[24m as its argument.

       [1m-j     [22mRun [4mchem[24m(1) preprocessor; implies [1m-p[22m.

              directive in the device description file specifies  the  default
              command  to be used; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5).  If no such directive is
              present for the output device, output is piped to  [4mlpr[24m(1).   See
              options [1m-L [22mand [1m-X[22m.

       [1m-L [4m[22marg[24m Pass [4marg[24m to the print spooler program.  If multiple [4marg[24ms are re‐
              quired, pass each with a separate [1m-L  [22moption.   [4mgroff[24m  does  not
              prefix  an  option  dash to [4marg[24m before passing it to the spooler
              program.

       [1m-M     [22mWorks as [4mtroff[24m’s option (see  below),  but  is  also  passed  to
              [4meqn[24m(1), [4mgrap[24m(1), and [4mgrn[24m(1).

       [1m-P [4m[22marg[24m Pass  [4marg[24m  to the postprocessor.  If multiple [4marg[24ms are required,
              pass each with a separate [1m-P [22moption.  [4mgroff[24m does not  prefix  an
              option dash to [4marg[24m before passing it to the postprocessor.

              [4mgroff[24m then calls an output driver to convert [4mtroff[24m’s output to a
              form appropriate for [4mdev[24m; see subsection “Output devices” below.

              Write version information for [4mgroff[24m and all programs run  by  it
              to  the  standard output stream; that is, the given command line
              is processed in the usual way, passing [1m-v [22mto the  formatter  and
              any pre‐ or postprocessors invoked.

              both writes and runs the pipeline.

              a document on an X11 display.  Combining this option  with  [1m-Tps[0m
              uses  the  font  metrics  of  the PostScript device, whereas the
              [1m-TX75 [22mand [1m-TX100 [22moptions use the metrics of X11 fonts.

       [1m-Z     [22mDisable postprocessing.  [4mtroff[24m output will appear on  the  stan‐

[1mUsage[0m
       The architecture of the GNU [4mroff[24m system follows that of  other  device‐
       independent [4mroff[24m implementations, comprising preprocessors, macro pack‐
       ages, output drivers (or “postprocessors”), a suite of  utilities,  and
       the  formatter  [4mtroff[24m  at its heart.  See [4mroff[24m(7) for a survey of how a
       [4mroff[24m system works.

       The front end programs available in the GNU [4mroff[24m system make it  easier
       to  use  than  traditional  [4mroff[24ms  that  required  the  construction of
       pipelines or use of temporary files to carry  a  source  document  from
       maintainable  form to device‐ready output.  The discussion below summa‐
       rizes the constituent parts of the GNU  [4mroff[24m  system.   It  complements
       [4mroff[24m(7) with [4mgroff[24m‐specific information.

   [1mGetting started[0m
       Those  who  prefer  to  learn by experimenting or are desirous of rapid
       feedback from the system may wish to start with a “Hello, world!” docu‐
       ment.

       $ [1mecho "Hello, world!" | groff -Tascii | sed '/^$/d'[0m
       Hello, world!

       We  used  a [4msed[24m command only to eliminate the 65 blank lines that would
       otherwise flood the terminal screen.  ([4mroff[24m systems were  developed  in
       the days of paper‐based terminals with 66 lines to a page.)

       Today’s users may prefer output to a UTF‐8‐capable terminal.

       $ [1mecho "Hello, world!" | groff -Tutf8 | sed '/^$/d'[0m

       Producing  PDF,  HTML,  or TeX’s DVI is also straightforward.  The hard
       part may be selecting a viewer program for the output.

       $ [1mecho "Hello, world!" | groff -Tpdf > hello.pdf[0m
       $ [1mevince hello.pdf[0m
       $ [1mecho "Hello, world!" | groff -Thtml > hello.html[0m
       $ [1mfirefox hello.html[0m
       $ [1mecho "Hello, world!" | groff -Tdvi > hello.dvi[0m
       $ [1mxdvi hello.html[0m

   [1mUsing [4mgroff[24m as a REPL[0m
       Those with a programmer’s bent may be pleased to know that they can use
       [4mgroff[24m  in  a read‐evaluate‐print loop (REPL).  Doing so can be handy to
       verify one’s understanding of the formatter’s behavior and/or the  syn‐
       tax it accepts.  Turning on all warnings with [1m-ww [22mcan aid this goal.

       It is even.

   [1mPaper format[0m
       In GNU [4mroff[24m, the page dimensions for the formatter [4mtroff[24m and for output
       devices are handled separately.  In the formatter, requests are used to
       set  the page length ([1m.pl[22m), page offset (or left margin, [1m.po[22m), and line
       length ([1m.ll[22m).  The right margin is not explicitly configured; the  com‐
       bination of page offset and line length provides the information neces‐
       sary to derive it.  The [4mpapersize[24m macro package,  automatically  loaded
       by [4mtroff[24m, provides an interface for configuring page dimensions by con‐
       venient names, like “letter” or “A4”; see [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5).   The  format‐
       ter’s default in this installation is “[1mletter[22m”.

       It  is  up to each macro package to respect the page dimensions config‐
       ured in this way.  Some offer alternative mechanisms.

       For each output device, the size of the output medium can be set in its
       [4mDESC[24m file.  Most output drivers also recognize a command‐line option [1m-p[0m
       to override the default dimensions and an option [1m-l  [22mto  use  landscape
       orientation.   See [4mgroff_font[24m(5) for a description of the [1mpapersize [22mdi‐
       rective, which takes an argument of the same form as  [1m-p[22m.   The  output
       driver’s  man  page, such as [4mgrops[24m(1), may also be helpful.  [4mgroff[24m uses
       the command‐line option [1m-P [22mto pass options to output devices; for exam‐
       ple,  use  the following for PostScript output on A4 paper in landscape
       orientation.

              groff -Tps -dpaper=a4l -P-pa4 -P-l -ms foo.ms > foo.ps

   [1mFront end[0m
       The [4mgroff[24m program is a wrapper around the [4mtroff[24m(1) program.  It  allows
       one to specify preprocessors via command‐line options and automatically
       runs the appropriate postprocessor for the selected output device.  Do‐
       ing so, the manual construction of pipelines or management of temporary
       files required of users of traditional [4mroff[24m(7) systems can be  avoided.
       Use  the  [4mgrog[24m(1) program to infer an appropriate [4mgroff[24m command line to
       format a document.

   [1mLanguage[0m
       Input to a [4mroff[24m system is in plain text interleaved with control  lines
       and escape sequences.  The combination constitutes a document in one of
       a family of languages we also call [4mroff[24m; see  [4mroff[24m(7)  for  background.
       An  overview  of GNU [4mroff[24m language syntax and features, including lists
       of all supported escape sequences, requests, and predefined  registers,
       can  be  found in [4mgroff[24m(7).  GNU [4mroff[24m extensions to the AT&T [4mtroff[24m lan‐
       guage, a common subset of [4mroff[24m dialects extant today, are  detailed  in
       [4mgroff_diff[24m(7).

   [1mPreprocessors[0m
       A preprocessor interprets a domain‐specific language that produces [4mroff[0m
       language output.  Frequently, such input is confined to sections or re‐
       gions of a [4mroff[24m input file (bracketed with macro calls specific to each
       preprocessor), which it replaces.  Preprocessors therefore often inter‐
       pret  a  subset of [4mroff[24m syntax along with their own language.  GNU [4mroff[0m
       provides reimplementations of most preprocessors familiar to  users  of
       AT&T  [4mtroff[24m;  these routinely have extended features and/or require GNU
       [4mtroff[24m to format their output.

              [4mtbl[24m         lays out tables;
              [4meqn[24m         typesets mathematics;

              [4mrefer[24m       processes bibliographic references;
              [4msoelim[24m      preprocesses “sourced” input files;
              [4mgrn[24m         renders [4mgremlin[24m(1) diagrams;
              [4mchem[24m        draws chemical structural formulæ using [4mpic[24m;
              [4mgperl[24m       populates [4mgroff[24m registers and strings using [4mperl[24m(1);
              [4mglilypond[24m   embeds [4mLilyPond[24m sheet music; and
              [4mgpinyin[24m     eases Mandarin Chinese input using Hanyu Pinyin.

       A preprocessor unique to GNU [4mroff[24m is [4mpreconv[24m(1), which converts various
       input  encodings  to something GNU [4mtroff[24m can understand.  When used, it
       is run before any other preprocessors.

       Most preprocessors enclose content between a pair of characteristic to‐
       kens.   Such  a  token must occur at the beginning of an input line and
       use the dot control character.  Spaces and tabs  must  not  follow  the
       control character or precede the end of the input line.  Deviating from
       these rules defeats a token’s recognition by the preprocessor.   Tokens
       are generally preserved in preprocessor output and interpreted as macro
       calls subsequently by [4mtroff[24m.  The [4mideal[24m preprocessor is not yet  avail‐
       able in [4mgroff[24m.

   [1mMacro packages[0m
       Macro  files  are  [4mroff[24m input files designed to produce no output them‐
       selves but instead ease the preparation of other [4mroff[24m documents.   When
       a  macro  file is installed at a standard location and suitable for use
       by a general audience, it is termed a [4mmacro[24m [4mpackage[24m.

       Macro packages can be loaded prior to any [4mroff[24m input documents with the
       [1m-m  [22moption.  The GNU [4mroff[24m system implements most well‐known macro pack‐
       ages for AT&T [4mtroff[24m in a compatible way and extends them.   These  have
       one‐ or two‐letter names arising from intense practices of naming econ‐
       omy in early Unix culture, a laconic approach that led to many  of  the
       packages being identified in general usage with the [4mnroff[24m and [4mtroff[24m op‐
       tion letter used to invoke them, sometimes to punning effect,  as  with
       “man”  (short  for  “manual”), and even with the option dash, as in the
       case of the [4ms[24m package, much better known as [4mms[24m or even [4m-ms[24m.

       Macro packages serve a variety of purposes.   Some  are  “full‐service”
       packages, adopting responsibility for page layout among other fundamen‐
       tal tasks, and defining their own lexicon of macros for document compo‐
       sition;  each such package stands alone and a given document can use at
       most one.

       [4man[24m     is used to compose man pages in the format originating  in  Ver‐
              sion  7  Unix  (1979); see [4mgroff_man[24m(7).  It can be specified on
              the command line as [1m-man[22m.

       [4mdoc[24m    is used to compose  man  pages  in  the  format  originating  in
              4.3BSD‐Reno  (1990);  see [4mgroff_mdoc[24m(7).  It can be specified on
              the command line as [1m-mdoc[22m.

       [4me[24m      is the Berkeley general‐purpose macro suite, developed as an al‐
              ternative  to AT&T’s [4ms[24m; see [4mgroff_me[24m(7).  It can be specified on
              the command line as [1m-me[22m.

       [4mm[24m      implements the format used by the second‐generation  AT&T  macro
              suite  for general documents, a successor to [4ms[24m; see [4mgroff_mm[24m(7).
              It can be specified on the command line as [1m-mm[22m.

       [4mom[24m     (invariably called “mom”) is a modern package written  by  Peter
              Schaffter  specifically for GNU [4mroff[24m.  Consult the [4mmom[24m HTML man‐
              ual for extensive documentation.  She—for [4mmom[24m takes  the  female
              pronoun—can be specified on the command line as [1m-mom[22m.

       [4ms[24m      is  the  original  AT&T  general‐purpose  document  format;  see
              [4mgroff_ms[24m(7).  It can be specified on the command line as [1m-ms[22m.

       Others are supplemental.  For instance, [4mandoc[24m is a wrapper package spe‐
       cific  to  GNU [4mroff[24m that recognizes whether a document uses [4mman[24m or [4mmdoc[0m
       format and loads the corresponding macro package.  It can be  specified
       on  the  command  line  as [1m-mandoc[22m.  A [4mman[24m(1) librarian program may use
       this macro file to delegate loading of the correct macro package; it is
       thus  unnecessary  for [4mman[24m itself to scan the contents of a document to
       decide the issue.

       Many macro files augment the function of the full‐service packages,  or
       of  [4mroff[24m  documents  that  do  not employ such a package—the latter are
       sometimes characterized as “raw”.  These  auxiliary  packages  are  de‐
       scribed,  along  with  details  of  macro file naming and placement, in
       [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5).

   [1mFormatters[0m
       The formatter, the program that  interprets  [4mroff[24m  language  input,  is
       [4mtroff[24m(1).   It  provides  the features of the AT&T [4mtroff[24m and [4mnroff[24m pro‐
       grams as well as many extensions.  The command‐line option [1m-C  [22mswitches
       [4mtroff[24m  into  [4mcompatibility[24m  [4mmode[24m,  which tries to emulate AT&T [4mtroff[24m as
       closely as is practical to enable the formatting of  documents  written
       for the older system.

       A  shell script, [4mnroff[24m(1), emulates the behavior of AT&T [4mnroff[24m.  It at‐
       tempts to correctly encode the output based on  the  locale,  relieving
       the user of the need to specify an output device with the [1m-T [22moption and
       is therefore convenient for use with terminal output devices, described
       in the next subsection.

       GNU  [4mtroff[24m generates output in a device‐independent, but not device‐ag‐
       nostic, page description language detailed in [4mgroff_out[24m(5).

   [1mOutput devices[0m
       [4mtroff[24m output is formatted for a  particular  [4moutput[24m  [4mdevice[24m,  typically
       specified by the [1m-T [22moption to the formatter or a front end.  If neither
       this option nor the [4mGROFF_TYPESETTER[24m environment variable is used,  the
       default  output  device is [1mps[22m.  An output device may be any of the fol‐
       lowing.

   [1mPostprocessors[0m
       Any program that interprets the output of GNU [4mtroff[24m is a postprocessor.
       The  postprocessors provided by GNU [4mroff[24m are [4moutput[24m [4mdrivers[24m, which pre‐
       pare a document for viewing or printing.  Postprocessors for other pur‐
       poses,  such as page resequencing or statistical measurement of a docu‐
       ment, are conceivable.

       An output driver supports one or more output devices, each with its own
       device  description  file.   A device determines its postprocessor with
       the  [1mpostpro  [22mdirective   in   its   device   description   file;   see
       [4mgroff_font[24m(5).    The  [1m-X  [22moption  overrides  this  selection,  causing
       [4mgxditview[24m to serve as the output driver.

       [4mgrodvi[24m(1)
              provides [1mdvi[22m.

       [4mgrohtml[24m(1)

       [4mgxditview[24m(1)
              provides [1mX75[22m, [1mX75-12[22m, [1mX100[22m, and [1mX100-12[22m,  and  additionally  can
              preview [1mps[22m.

   [1mUtilities[0m
       GNU [4mroff[24m includes a suite of utilities.

       [4mgdiffmk[24m(1)
              marks differences between a pair of [4mroff[24m input files.

       [4mgrog[24m(1)
              infers the [4mgroff[24m command a document requires.

       Several utilities prepare descriptions of fonts, enabling the formatter
       to use them when producing output for a given device.

       [4maddftinfo[24m(1)
              adds information to AT&T [4mtroff[24m font description files to  enable
              their use with GNU [4mtroff[24m.

       [4mafmtodit[24m(1)
              creates font description files for PostScript Type 1 fonts.

       [4mpfbtops[24m(1)
              translates a PostScript Type 1 font in PFB (Printer Font Binary)
              format to PFA (Printer Font ASCII), which  can  then  be  inter‐
              preted by [4mafmtodit[24m.

       [4mhpftodit[24m(1)
              creates  font  description files for the HP LaserJet 4 family of
              printers.

       [4mtfmtodit[24m(1)
              creates font description files for the TeX DVI device.

       [4mxtotroff[24m(1)
              creates font description files for X Window System core fonts.

       A trio of tools transform material constructed using [4mroff[24m  preprocessor
       languages into graphical image files.

       [4meqn2graph[24m(1)
              converts an [4meqn[24m equation into a cropped image.

       [4mgrap2graph[24m(1)
              converts a [4mgrap[24m diagram into a cropped image.

       [4mpic2graph[24m(1)
              converts a [4mpic[24m diagram into a cropped image.

       Another set of programs works with the bibliographic data files used by
       the [4mrefer[24m(1) preprocessor.

       [4mindxbib[24m(1)
              makes inverted indices  for  bibliographic  databases,  speeding
              lookup operations on them.

       [4mlkbib[24m(1)
              searches the databases.

       [4mlookbib[24m(1)
              interactively searches the databases.

[1mExit status[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  exits  with  a failure status if there was a problem parsing its
       arguments and a successful status if either of the options [1m-h [22mor [1m--help[0m
       was  specified.  Otherwise, [4mgroff[24m runs a pipeline to process its input;
       if all commands within the pipeline exit successfully, [4mgroff[24m does like‐
       wise.   If  not,  [4mgroff[24m’s exit status encodes a summary of problems en‐
       countered, setting bit 0 if a command exited  with  a  failure  status,
       bit 1 if a command was terminated with a signal, and bit 2 if a command
       could not be executed.  (Thus, if all three  misfortunes  befell  one’s
       pipeline,  [4mgroff[24m  would  exit with status 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1+2+4 = 7.)
       To troubleshoot pipeline problems, you may wish  to  re‐run  the  [4mgroff[0m
       command  with  the  [1m-V [22moption and break the reported pipeline down into
       separate stages, inspecting the exit status of and diagnostic  messages
       emitted by each command.

[1mEnvironment[0m
       Normally,  the path separator in environment variables ending with [4mPATH[0m
       is the colon; this may vary depending on the operating system.  For ex‐
       ample, Windows uses a semicolon instead.

       [4mGROFF_BIN_PATH[0m
              This  search  path, followed by [4mPATH[24m, is used to locate commands
              executed by [4mgroff[24m.  If it is not set, the installation directory
              of the GNU [4mroff[24m executables, [4m/usr/bin[24m, is searched before [4mPATH[24m.

       [4mGROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX[0m
              GNU  [4mroff[24m can be configured at compile time to apply a prefix to
              the names of the programs it provides that had a counterpart  in
              AT&T  [4mtroff[24m,  so  that  name collisions are avoided at run time.
              The default prefix is empty.

              When used, this prefix is conventionally the  letter  “g”.   For
              example, GNU [4mtroff[24m would be installed as [4mgtroff[24m.  Besides [4mtroff[24m,
              the prefix applies to the  formatter  [4mnroff[24m;  the  preprocessors
              [4meqn[24m, [4mgrn[24m, [4mpic[24m, [4mrefer[24m, [4mtbl[24m, and [4msoelim[24m; and the utilities [4mindxbib[0m
              and [4mlookbib[24m.

       [4mGROFF_ENCODING[0m
              The value of this variable is  passed  to  the  [4mpreconv[24m(1)  pre‐
              processor’s  [1m-e [22moption to select the character encoding of input

              If  set  but  empty,  [4mgroff[24m  calls [4mpreconv[24m without an [1m-e [22moption.
              [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-K [22moption overrides [4mGROFF_ENCODING[24m.

       [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[0m
              Seek the selected output device’s directory of device  and  font
              description files in this list of directories.  See [4mtroff[24m(1) and
              [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

              Create  temporary  files in this directory.  If not set, but the
              environment variable [4mTMPDIR[24m is set, temporary files are  created
              there  instead.  On Windows systems, if neither of the foregoing
              are set, the environment variables [4mTMP[24m and [4mTEMP[24m (in that  order)
              are  checked  also.   Otherwise,  temporary files are created in
              [4m/tmp[24m.  The [4mrefer[24m(1), [4mgrohtml[24m(1), and [4mgrops[24m(1) commands use  tem‐
              porary files.

       [4mGROFF_TYPESETTER[0m
              Set the default output device.  If empty or not set, [1mps [22mis used.
              The [1m-T [22moption overrides [4mGROFF_TYPESETTER[24m.

       [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[0m
              A time stamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to  use
              as  the output creation time stamp in place of the current time.
              The time is converted to human‐readable form using  [4mlocaltime[24m(3)
              when  the  formatter starts up and stored in registers usable by
              documents and macro packages.

       [4mTZ[24m     The time zone to use when converting the current time (or  value
              of [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[24m) to human‐readable form; see [4mtzset[24m(3).

[1mExamples[0m
       [4mroff[24m  systems  are  best known for formatting man pages.  Once a [4mman[24m(1)
       librarian program has located a man page, it may execute a  [4mgroff[24m  com‐
       mand much like the following.
              groff -t -man -Tutf8 /usr/share/man/man1/groff.1
       The  librarian  will  also pipe the output through a pager, which might
       not interpret the SGR terminal escape sequences [4mgroff[24m emits  for  bold‐
       face, underlining, or italics; see section “Limitations” below.

       To  process  a  [4mroff[24m input file using the preprocessors [4mtbl[24m and [4mpic[24m and
       the [4mme[24m macro package in the way to which AT&T [4mtroff[24m users  were  accus‐
       tomed, one would type (or script) a pipeline.

              pic foo.me | tbl | troff -me -Tutf8 | grotty

       Using [4mgroff[24m, this pipe can be shortened to an equivalent command.

              groff -p -t -me -T utf8 foo.me

       An even easier way to do this is to use [4mgrog[24m(1) to guess the preproces‐
       sor and macro options and execute the result by using the command  sub‐
       stitution feature of the shell.

              $(grog -Tutf8 foo.me)

       Each  command‐line option to a postprocessor must be specified with any
       required leading dashes “[1m-[22m” because [4mgroff[24m passes the arguments as‐is to
       the  postprocessor; this permits arbitrary arguments to be transmitted.
       For example, to pass a title to the [4mgxditview[24m postprocessor, the  shell
       commands
              groff -X -P -title -P 'trial run' mydoc.t
       and
              groff -X -Z mydoc.t | gxditview -title 'trial run' -
       are equivalent.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mgrog[24m reads its input and guesses which [4mgroff[24m(1) options are  needed  to
       render it.  If no operands are given, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mgrog[24m reads the
       standard input stream.  The corresponding  [4mgroff[24m  command  is  normally
       written  to the standard output stream.  With the option [1m--run[22m, the in‐
       ferred command is written to the standard error stream  and  then  exe‐
       cuted.

[1mOptions[0m
       [1m-h [22mand [1m--help [22mdisplay a usage message, whereas [1m-v [22mand [1m--version [22mdisplay
       version information; all exit afterward.

       [1m--ligatures[0m
              includes the arguments [1m-P-y -PU [22min the inferred  [4mgroff[24m  command.
              These are supported only by the [1mpdf [22moutput device.

       [1m--run  [22mwrites  the  inferred  command  to the standard error stream and
              then executes it.

       All other specified short options (that is, arguments beginning with  a
       minus  sign  “[1m-[22m” followed by a letter) are interpreted as [4mgroff[24m options
       or option clusters with or without an option  argument.   Such  options
       are included in the constructed [4mgroff[24m command line.

[1mDetails[0m
       [4mgrog[24m reads each [4mfile[24m operand, pattern‐matching strings that are statis‐
       tically likely to be characteristic of [4mroff[24m(7) documents.  It tries  to
       guess  which  of  the following [4mgroff[24m options are required to correctly
       render the input: [1m-e[22m, [1m-g[22m, [1m-G[22m, [1m-j[22m, [1m-p[22m, [1m-R[22m, [1m-t [22m(preprocessors); and [1m-man[22m,
       [1m-mdoc[22m,  [1m-mdoc-old[22m,  [1m-me[22m,  [1m-mm[22m, [1m-mom[22m, and [1m-ms [22m(macro packages).  The in‐
       ferred [4mgroff[24m command including these options and any [4mfile[24m parameters is
       written to the standard output stream.

       It  is possible to specify arbitrary [4mgroff[24m options on the command line.
       These are included in the inferred command without change.  Choices  of
       [4mgroff[24m options include [1m-C [22mto enable AT&T [4mtroff[24m compatibility mode and [1m-T[0m
       to select a non‐default output device.  If the input is not encoded  in
       US‐ASCII,  ISO  8859‐1, or IBM code page 1047, specification of a [4mgroff[0m
       option to run the [4mpreconv[24m(1) preprocessor is advised; see the  [1m-D[22m,  [1m-k[22m,
       and [1m-K [22moptions of [4mgroff[24m(1).  For UTF‐8 input, [1m-k [22mis a good choice.

       [4mgroff[24m may issue diagnostic messages when an inappropriate [1m-m [22moption, or
       multiple conflicting ones, are specified.  Consequently, it is best  to
       specify  no  [1m-m [22moptions to [4mgrog[24m unless it cannot correctly infer all of
       the [1m-m [22marguments a document requires.  A  [4mroff[24m  document  can  also  be
       written  without  recourse  to  any macro package.  In such cases, [4mgrog[0m
       will infer a [4mgroff[24m command without an [1m-m [22moption.

   [1mLimitations[0m
       [4mgrog[24m presumes that the input does not change the  escape,  control,  or
       no‐break  control characters.  [4mgrog[24m does not parse [4mroff[24m input line con‐
       tinuation or control structures (brace escape sequences and  the  “[1mif[22m”,
       “[1mie[22m”, and “[1mel[22m” requests) nor [4mgroff[24m’s “[1mwhile[22m”.  Thus the input

              t .NH 1
              .if n .SH
              Introduction
       will  conceal  the use of the [4mms[24m macros [1mNH [22mand [1mSH [22mfrom [4mgrog[24m.  Such con‐
       structions are regarded by [4mgrog[24m’s implementors as insufficiently common
       to  cause  many inference problems.  Preprocessors can be even stricter
       when matching macro calls that bracket the regions  of  an  input  file
       they replace.  [4mpic[24m, for example, requires [1mPS[22m, [1mPE[22m, and [1mPF [22mcalls to imme‐
       diately follow the default control character  at  the  beginning  of  a
       line.

       Detection  of  the [1m-s [22moption (the [4msoelim[24m(1) preprocessor) is tricky; to
       correctly infer its necessity would require [4mgrog[24m  to  recursively  open
       all  files  given as arguments to the [1m.so [22mrequest under the same condi‐
       tions that [4msoelim[24m itself does so; see its man page.  Recall that [4msoelim[0m
       is necessary only if sourced files need to be preprocessed.  Therefore,
       as a workaround, you may want to run the input through [4msoelim[24m manually,
       piping  it to [4mgrog[24m, and compare the output to running [4mgrog[24m on the input
       directly.  If the “[4msoelim[24m”ed input causes [4mgrog[24m to infer additional pre‐
       processor options, then [1m-s [22mis likely necessary.

       at the command line results in
              groff -me /usr/share/doc/groff-1.23.0/meintro.me
       because [4mgrog[24m recognizes that  the  file  [4mmeintro.me[24m  is  written  using
       macros from the [4mme[24m package.  The command
              [1mgrog /usr/share/doc/groff-1.23.0/pic.ms[0m

              groff -e -p -t -ms /usr/share/doc/groff-1.23.0/pic.ms
       on  the other hand.  Besides discerning the [4mms[24m macro package, [4mgrog[24m rec‐
       ognizes that the file [4mpic.ms[24m additionally needs the combination  of  [1m-t[0m

       Consider  a  file  [4mdoc/grnexampl.me[24m, which uses the [4mgrn[24m preprocessor to
       include a [4mgremlin[24m(1) picture file in an [4mme[24m document.  Let’s say we want
       to  suppress  color  output, produce a DVI file, and get backtraces for
       any errors that [4mtroff[24m encounters.  The command
              [1mgrog -bc -Idoc -Tdvi doc/grnexmpl.me[0m
       is processed by [4mgrog[24m into
              groff -bc -Idoc -Tdvi -e -g -me doc/grnexmpl.me
       where we can see that [4mgrog[24m has inferred the [4mme[24m macro package along with
       the  [4meqn[24m  and  [4mgrn[24m  preprocessors.  (The input file is located in [4m/usr/[0m

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m  system’s  HTML  support  consists  of  a  preprocessor,
       [4mpre-grohtml[24m, and an output driver, [4mpost-grohtml[24m; together, they  trans‐
       late  [4mroff[24m(7)  documents to HTML.  Because a preprocessor is (uniquely)
       required for this output driver, users should invoke  [4mgrohtml[24m  via  the
       [4mgroff[24m(1)  command with the [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml [22moptions.  (In this instal‐
       lation, [1mps [22mis the default output device.)  Use  [4mgroff[24m’s  [1m-P  [22moption  to
       pass  any options shown above to [4mgrohtml[24m.  If no operands are given, or
       if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mgrohtml[24m reads the standard  input  stream.   Output  is
       written to the standard output stream.

       [4mgrohtml[24m  invokes  [4mgroff[24m  twice.   In  the  first pass, the preprocessor
       [4mpre-grohtml[24m renders pictures, equations, and tables as images in  Post‐
       Script format using the [1mps [22moutput device.  In the second pass, the out‐
       put driver [4mpost-grohtml[24m translates the output of [4mtroff[24m(1) to HTML.

       [4mgrohtml[24m writes output encoded in UTF‐8 and has built‐in  HTML  entities
       for  all non‐composite Unicode characters.  In spite of this, [4mgroff[24m may
       issue warnings about unknown special characters if they can’t be  found
       during  the first pass.  Such warnings can be safely ignored unless the
       special characters appear inside a table or equation.

   [1mTypefaces[0m
       [4mgrohtml[24m supports the standard four styles: [1mR  [22m(roman),  [1mI  [22m([4mitalic[24m),  [1mB[0m
       ([1mbold[22m),  and [1mBI [22m([4m[1mbold‐italic[24m[22m).  Fonts are grouped into families [1mT [22mand [1mC[0m
       having members in each style.

              [1mTR     [22mTimes roman
              [1mTI     [22mTimes italic

       A special font, [1mS[22m, is also provided to accommodate [4mroff[24m documents  that
       expect it to always be available.

   [1mFont description files[0m
       The  font  description  files  used  with [4mgrohtml[24m expose the same glyph
       repertoire in their [1mcharset [22msections.  See [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

   [1mDependencies[0m
       [4mpre-grohtml[24m generates an image whenever an [4meqn[24m equation, [4mtbl[24m table,  or
       [4mpic[24m  picture  is  encountered  in the input.  [4mgrohtml[24m therefore may run
       several commands as part of its operation.  These  include  the  Netpbm
       tools  [4mpnmcrop[24m, [4mpnmcut[24m, and [4mpnmtopng[24m; Ghostscript ([4mgs[24m); and the PSUtils

[1mDescription[0m
       This  GNU  [4mroff[24m  output driver translates the output of [4mtroff[24m(1) into a
       CaPSL and VDM format suitable for Canon LBP‐4 and LBP‐8 printers.  Nor‐
       mally,  [4mgrolbp[24m  is  invoked  by  [4mgroff[24m(1)  when the latter is given the
       “[1m-T lbp[22m” option.  (In this installation, [1mps [22mis the default  output  de‐
       vice.)   Use  [4mgroff[24m’s  [1m-P  [22moption  to  pass  any options shown above to
       [4mgrolbp[24m.  If no [4mfile[24m arguments are given, or  if  [4mfile[24m  is  “-”,  [4mgrolbp[0m
       reads  the  standard  input  stream.  Output is written to the standard
       output stream.

   [1mTypefaces[0m
       The driver supports the Dutch, Swiss, and Swiss‐Narrow  scalable  type‐
       faces,  each in the regular, bold, italic, and bold‐italic styles.  Ad‐
       ditionally, the bitmapped, monospaced Courier and Elite  typefaces  are
       available  in  regular,  bold,  and  italic styles; Courier at 8 and 12
       points, Elite at 8 and 10 points.  The following chart  summarizes  the
       [4mgroff[24m font names used to access them.

   [1mPaper format, orientation, and device description file[0m
       [4mgrolbp[24m supports paper formats “[1mA4[22m”, “[1mletter[22m”, “[1mlegal[22m”, and “[1mexecutive[22m”.
       These are matched case‐insensitively.  The [1m-p[22m, [1m--papersize [22moption over‐
       rides  any  setting  in  the  device description file [4mDESC[24m.  If neither
       specifies a paper format, A4 is assumed.

       In its [4mDESC[24m file, [4mgrolbp[24m (case‐insensitively) recognizes an [1morientation[0m
       directive accepting one mandatory argument, [1mportrait [22mor [1mlandscape[22m.  The
       first valid orientation directive encountered controls.   The  [1m-l[22m,  [1m-o[22m,
       and  [1m--orientation  [22mcommand‐line  options override any setting in [4mDESC[24m.
       If none of the foregoing specify the orientation, portrait is assumed.

   [1mFont description files[0m
       In addition to the  font  description  file  directives  documented  in
       [4mgroff_font[24m(5),  [4mgrolbp[24m  recognizes  [1mlbpname[22m,  which maps the [4mgroff[24m font
       name to the font name used internally by the printer.  Its syntax is as
       follows.
              lbpname [4mprinter‐font‐name[0m
       [1mlbpname[22m’s argument is case‐sensitive.  The printer’s font names are en‐
       coded as follows.

       For bitmapped fonts, [4mprinter‐font_name[24m has the form
              N⟨[4mbase‐font‐name[24m⟩⟨[4mfont‐style[24m⟩
       [4mbase‐font‐name[24m is the font name as it appears  in  the  printer’s  font
       listings  without  the first letter, up to (but not including) the font
       size.  [4mfont‐style[24m can be one of the letters [1mR[22m, [1mI[22m, or [1mB[22m, indicating  the
       roman,  italic,  and  bold  styles, respectively.  For instance, if the
       printer’s “font listing A” shows “Nelite12I.ISO_USA”, the corresponding
       entry in the [4mgroff[24m font description file is
              lbpname NeliteI
       You  may  need to modify [4mgrolbp[24m to add support for new bitmapped fonts,
       since the available font names and font sizes of  bitmapped  fonts  (as
       documented above) are hard‐coded into the program.

       For  scalable fonts, [4mprinter‐font‐name[24m is identical to the font name as
       it appears in the printer’s “font listing A”.  For instance, to  select
       the  “Swiss” font in bold‐italic style, which appears in the font list‐
       ing as “Swiss-BoldOblique”,
              lbpname Swiss-BoldOblique
       is the required directive, and this is what we find in the  [4mgroff[24m  font
       description file [4mHBI[24m for the [1mlbp [22mdevice.

       Nominally,  all  Hewlett‐Packard  LaserJet  4‐series and newer printers
       have the same internal fonts:  45  scalable  fonts  and  one  bitmapped
       Lineprinter  font.   The  scalable fonts are available in sizes between
       0.25  points  and  999.75  points,  in   0.25‐point   increments;   the
       Lineprinter font is available only in 8.5‐point size.

       The  LaserJet  font  files included with [4mgroff[24m assume that all printers
       since the LaserJet 4 are identical.  There are some differences between
       fonts in the earlier and more recent printers, however.  The LaserJet 4
       printer used Agfa Intellifont technology for 35 of the  internal  scal‐
       able  fonts;  the remaining 10 scalable fonts were TrueType.  Beginning
       with the LaserJet 4000‐series printers introduced in 1997, all scalable
       internal fonts have been TrueType.  The number of printable glyphs dif‐
       fers slightly between Intellifont and TrueType  fonts  (generally,  the
       TrueType  fonts  include more glyphs), and there are some minor differ‐
       ences in glyph metrics.  Differences among printer models are described
       in  the  [4mPCL[24m [4m5[24m [4mComparison[24m [4mGuide[24m and the [4mPCL[24m [4m5[24m [4mComparison[24m [4mGuide[24m [4mAddendum[0m
       (for printers introduced since approximately 2001).

       LaserJet printers reference a glyph by a  combination  of  a  256‐glyph
       symbol  set and an index within that symbol set.  Many glyphs appear in
       more than one symbol set; all combinations of symbol set and index that
       reference  the  same glyph are equivalent.  For each glyph, [4mhpftodit[24m(1)
       searches a list of symbol sets, and selects the first set that contains
       the  glyph.  The printing code generated by [4mhpftodit[24m is an integer that
       encodes a numerical value for the symbol set in the high  byte(s),  and
       the  index  in the low byte.  See [4mgroff_font[24m(5) for a complete descrip‐
       tion of the font file format; symbol sets are described in greater  de‐
       tail in the [4mPCL[24m [4m5[24m [4mPrinter[24m [4mLanguage[24m [4mTechnical[24m [4mReference[24m [4mManual[24m.

       Two of the scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to 256‐glyph
       symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as  the  Lineprinter
       font,  support  numerous  symbol sets, sufficient to enable printing of
       more than 600 glyphs.

       The metrics generated by [4mhpftodit[24m assume that the  [4mDESC[24m  file  contains
       values  of  1200  for  [4mres[24m  and  6350 for [4munitwidth[24m, or any combination
       (e.g., 2400 and 3175) for which [4mres[24m × [4munitwidth[24m = 7620000.  Although HP
       PCL  5  LaserJet  printers support an internal resolution of 7200 units
       per inch, they use a 16‐bit signed integer for positioning;  if  [1mdevlj4[0m
       is to support U.S. ledger paper (11 in × 17 in; in = inch), the maximum
       usable resolution is 32767 ÷ 17, or 1927 units per inch,  which  rounds
       down  to  1200 units per inch.  If the largest required paper dimension
       is less (e.g., 8.5 in × 11 in,  or  A5),  a  greater  [4mres[24m  (and  lesser
       [4munitwidth[24m) can be specified.

       Font  metrics for Intellifont fonts were provided by Tagged Font Metric
       (TFM) files originally developed by Agfa/Compugraphic.  The  TFM  files
       provided  for these fonts supported 600+ glyphs and contained extensive
       lists of kerning pairs.

       To accommodate developers who had become accustomed to  TFM  files,  HP
       also  provided  TFM  files  for  the  10 TrueType fonts included in the
       LaserJet 4.  The TFM files for TrueType fonts generally  included  less
       information  than the Intellifont TFMs, supporting fewer glyphs, and in
       most cases, providing no kerning information.  By the time  the  Laser‐
       Jet  4000 printer was introduced, most developers had migrated to other
       means of obtaining font metrics, and support for new TFM files was very
       limited.   The  TFM files provided for the TrueType fonts in the Laser‐
       Jet 4000 support only the Latin 2 (ISO 8859‐2) symbol set, and  include
       no  kerning information; consequently, they are of little value for any
       but the most rudimentary documents.

       Because the Intellifont TFM files contain  considerably  more  informa‐
       tion,  they generally are preferable to the TrueType TFM files even for
       use with the TrueType fonts in the newer printers.  The metrics for the
       TrueType  fonts  are very close, though not identical, to those for the
       earlier Intellifont fonts of the same names.  Although most output  us‐
       ing  the  Intellifont  metrics with the newer printers is quite accept‐
       able, a few glyphs may fail to print as expected.  The  differences  in
       glyph  metrics  may be particularly noticeable with composite parenthe‐
       ses, brackets, and braces used by [4meqn[24m(1).  A script, located  in  [4m/usr/[0m
       [4mshare/groff/1.23.0/font/devlj4/generate[24m, can be used to adjust the met‐
       rics for these glyphs in the special font “S”  for  use  with  printers
       that have all TrueType fonts.

       At  the  time HP last supported TFM files, only version 1.0 of the Uni‐
       code standard was available.  Consequently,  many  glyphs  lacking  as‐
       signed  code  points were assigned by HP to the Private Use Area (PUA).
       Later versions of the Unicode standard included code points outside the
       PUA  for  many of these glyphs.  The HP‐supplied TrueType TFM files use
       the PUA assignments; TFM files generated from more recent TrueType font
       files require the later Unicode values to access the same glyphs.  Con‐
       sequently, two different mapping files may be required: one for the HP‐
       supplied TFM files, and one for more recent TFM files.

       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m PDF output driver translates the output of [4mtroff[24m(1) into
       Portable Document Format.  Normally, [4mgropdf[24m is invoked by [4mgroff[24m(1) when
       the  latter is given the “[1m-T pdf[22m” option.  (In this installation, [1mps [22mis
       the default output device.)  Use [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-P [22moption to pass any  options
       shown  above  to [4mgropdf[24m.  If no [4mfile[24m arguments are given, or if [4mfile[24m is
       “-”, [4mgropdf[24m reads the standard input stream.  Output is written to  the
       standard output stream.

              omitting the argument.

       [1m-y [4m[22mfoundry[0m
              Set the foundry to use for selecting fonts of the same name.

[1mUsage[0m
       The  input to [4mgropdf[24m must be in the format output by [4mtroff[24m(1).  This is
       described in [4mgroff_out[24m(5).  In addition, the device and  font  descrip‐
       tion files for the device used must meet certain requirements: The res‐
       olution must be an integer multiple of 72 times the [1msizescale[22m.  The [1mpdf[0m
       device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of 1000.

       The  device  description  file  must  contain a valid paper format; see
       [4mgroff_font[24m(5).  [4mgropdf[24m uses the same Type 1 Adobe PostScript  fonts  as
       the  [1mgrops  [22mdevice driver.  Although the PDF Standard allows the use of
       other font types (like TrueType) this implementation only  accepts  the
       Type  1  PostScript font.  Fewer Type 1 fonts are supported natively in
       PDF documents than the standard 35 fonts supported  by  [1mgrops  [22mand  all
       PostScript  printers,  but  all the fonts are available since any which
       aren’t supported natively are automatically embedded in the PDF.

       [4mgropdf[24m supports the concept of foundries, that is different versions of
       basically  the same font.  During install a [4mFoundry[24m file controls where
       fonts are found and builds [4mgroff[24m fonts from the files it  discovers  on
       your system.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              [1minternalname [4m[22mpsname[0m

       which  says  that  the  PostScript  name  of the font is [4mpsname[24m.  Lines
       starting with [1m# [22mand blank lines are ignored.  The code for each charac‐
       ter  given  in the font file must correspond to the code in the default
       encoding for the font.  This code can be used with the  [1m\N  [22mescape  se‐
       quence in [1mtroff [22mto select the character, even if the character does not
       have a [4mgroff[24m name.  Every character in the font file must exist in  the
       PostScript  font,  and the widths given in the font file must match the
       widths used in the PostScript font.

       Note that [4mgropdf[24m is currently only able to display the first 256 glyphs
       in any font.  This restriction will be lifted in a later version.

       [4mgropdf[24m  can  automatically  include the downloadable fonts necessary to
       print the document.  Fonts may be in PFA or PFB format.

       Any downloadable fonts which should,  when  required,  be  included  by
       [4mgropdf[24m  must be listed in the file [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devpdf/[0m
       [4mdownload[24m; this should consist of lines of the form

              [4mfoundry[24m [4mfont[24m [4mfilename[0m

       where [4mfoundry[24m is the foundry name or blank  for  the  default  foundry.
       [4mfont[24m  is  the  PostScript name of the font, and [4mfilename[24m is the name of
       the file containing the font; lines beginning with [1m#  [22mand  blank  lines
       are ignored; fields must be separated by tabs (spaces are [1mnot [22mallowed);
       [4mfilename[24m is searched for using the same  mechanism  that  is  used  for
       [4mgroff[24m font metric files.  The [4mdownload[24m file itself is also sought using
       this mechanism.  Foundry names are usually a single character (such  as
       ‘U’  for  the  URW foundry) or empty for the default foundry.  This de‐
       fault uses the same fonts as [4mghostscript[24m uses when it embeds fonts in a
       PDF file.

       In the default setup there are styles called [1mR[22m, [1mI[22m, [1mB[22m, and [1mBI [22mmounted at
       font positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families [1mA[22m,  [1mBM[22m,  [1mC[22m,
       [1mH[22m, [1mHN[22m, [1mN[22m, [1mP[22m, and [1mT [22mhaving members in each of these styles:

              (see documentation in [4mpdfmark.pdf[24m).  A subset  of  these  macros
              are installed automatically when you use [1m-Tpdf [22mso you should not
              need to use “[1m-m pdfmark[22m” to access most PDF functionality.

       [4mgropdf[24m  also  supports  a  subset  of  the   commands   introduced   in
       [4mpresent.tmac[24m.  Specifically it supports:‐

              PAUSE
              BLOCKS
              BLOCKE

       Which  allows  you to create presentation type PDFs.  Many of the other
       commands are already available in other macro packages.

       These commands are implemented with [4mgroff[24m X commands:‐

       [1m\X'ps: exec %%%%PAUSE'[0m
              The section before this is treated as a block and is  introduced
              using the current [1mBLOCK [22mtransition setting (see “[1m\X'pdf: transi‐[0m
              [1mtion'[22m” below).  Equivalently, [1m.pdfpause [22mis available as a macro.

       [1m\X'ps: exec %%%%BEGINONCE'[0m
              Any text following this command (up  to  %%%%ENDONCE)  is  shown
              only  once,  the  next %%%%PAUSE will remove it.  If producing a
              non‐presentation   PDF,   i.e.   ignoring   the   pauses,    see
              [4mGROPDF_NOSLIDE[24m below, this text is ignored.

       [1m\X'ps: exec %%%%ENDONCE'[0m
              This  terminates  the block defined by %%%%BEGINONCE.  This pair
              of commands is what implements the .BLOCKS Once/.BLOCKE commands
              in [4mpresent.tmac[24m.

       The  [4mmom[24m  macro package already integrates these extensions, so you can
       build slides with [4mmom[24m.

       If you use [4mpresent.tmac[24m with [4mgropdf[24m there is no need to run the program
       [4mpresentps[24m(1) since the output will already be a presentation PDF.

       All other [1mps: [22mtags are silently ignored.

       One  [1m\X  [22mdevice  control  command used by the DVI driver is also recog‐
       nised.

       [1m\X'papersize=[4m[22mpaper‐format[24m[1m'[0m
              where the [4mpaper‐format[24m parameter is the same as that to the  [1mpa‐[0m
              [1mpersize  [22mdirective.  See [4mgroff_font[24m(5).  This means that you can
              alter the page size at will within the PDF file being created by
              [4mgropdf[24m.   If  you do want to change the paper format, it must be
              done before you start creating the page.

       [4mgropdf[24m supports several more device control  features  using  the  [1mpdf:[0m
       tag.  Some have counterpart [4mconvenience[24m [4mmacros[24m that take the same argu‐
       ments and behave equivalently.

              Place an image of the specified [4mwidth[24m containing the PDF drawing
              from file [4mfile[24m of desired [4mwidth[24m and [4mheight[24m (if [4mheight[24m is missing
              or zero then it is scaled proportionally).  If [4malignment[24m  is  [1m-L[0m
              the  drawing  is  left‐aligned.  If it is [1m-C [22mor [1m-R [22ma [4mline‐length[0m
              greater than the width of the drawing is required as  well.   If
              [4mwidth[24m  is  specified as zero then the width is scaled in propor‐
              tion to the height.

       [1m\X'pdf: xrev'[0m
              Toggle the reversal of  glyph  direction.   This  feature  works
              “letter  by  letter”, that is, each letter in a word is reversed
              left‐to‐right, not the entire word.  One application is the  re‐
              versal of glyphs in the Zapf Dingbats font.  To restore the nor‐
              mal glyph orientation, repeat the command.

              If you use a page location trap to produce a header  or  footer,
              or  otherwise interrupt a document’s text, you need to use these
              commands if a PDF [4mhot[24m [4mspot[24m crosses a  trap  boundary;  otherwise
              any  text  output  by the trap will be marked as part of the hot
              spot.  To prevent this error, place these  device  control  com‐
              mands  or their corresponding convenience macros [1m.pdfmarksuspend[0m
              and [1m.pdfmarkrestart [22mat the start and end of the trap macro,  re‐

       [1m\X'pdf: pagename [4m[22mname[24m[1m'[0m
              Assign  the current page a [4mname[24m.  All documents bear two default
              names, ‘[1mtop[22m’ and ‘[1mbottom[22m’.  The convenience macro for this  com‐
              mand is [1m.pdfpagename[22m.

       [1m\X’pdf: switchtopage [4m[22mwhen[24m [4mname[24m[1m'[0m
              Normally  each  new page is appended to the end of the document,
              this command allows following pages to be inserted at a  [4m‘named’[0m
              position  within  the  document  (see  pagename  command above).
              [4m‘when’[24m can be either ‘[4mafter[24m’ or ‘[4mbefore[24m’.  If it is  omitted  it
              defaults  to ‘[4mbefore[24m’.  It should be used at the end of the page
              before you want the switch to happen.  This allows pages such as
              a  TOC  to  be moved to elsewhere in the document, but more eso‐
              teric uses are possible.  The convenience macro for this command
              is [1m.pdfswitchtopage[22m.

              the course of the transition

              [4mbool[24m (Optional; PDF 1.5; [1mFly [22mtransition style only) If [1mtrue[22m, the
              area that shall be flown in is rectangular and opaque.

              This command can be used by calling the macro [1m.pdftransition [22mus‐
              ing the parameters described above.  Any of the  parameters  may
              be replaced with a "." which signifies the parameter retains its
              previous value, also any trailing  missing  parameters  are  ig‐
              nored.

              [1mNote: [22mnot all PDF Readers support any or all these transitions.

       [1m\X'pdf: background footnote [4m[22mbottom[24m[1m'[0m
              produces a background rectangle on the page, where

              [4mcmd[24m    is  the  command,  which can be any of “[1mpage[22m|[1mfill[22m|[1mbox[22m” in
                     combination.  Thus, “[1mpagefill[22m”  would  draw  a  rectangle
                     which  covers  the whole current page size (in which case
                     the rest of the parameters can be omitted because the box
                     dimensions are taken from the current media size).  “[1mbox‐[0m
                     [1mfill[22m”, on the other hand, requires the  given  dimensions
                     to  place  the box.  Including “[1mfill[22m” in the command will
                     paint the rectangle with the current fill colour (as with
                     [1m\M[][22m)  and including “[1mbox[22m” will give the rectangle a bor‐
                     der in the current stroke colour (as with [1m\m[][22m).

                     [4mcmd[24m may also be “[1moff[22m” on its own,  which  will  terminate
                     drawing  the  current  box.  If you have specified a page
                     colour with “[1mpagefill[22m”, it is always the first box in the
                     stack,  and  if you specify it again, it will replace the
                     first entry.  Be aware that the  “[1mpagefill[22m”  box  renders
                     the  page opaque, so tools that “watermark” PDF pages are
                     unlikely to be successful.  To return the  background  to
                     transparent,  issue  an “[1moff[22m” command with no other boxes
                     open.

                     Finally, [4mcmd[24m may be “[1mfootnote[22m” followed by  a  new  value
                     for  [4mbottom[24m, which will be used for all open boxes on the
                     current page.  This is to allow room for  footnote  areas
                     that  grow while a page is processed (to accommodate mul‐
                     tiple footnotes, for instance).  (If the value  is  nega‐
                     tive,  it  is  used  as  an offset from the bottom of the
                     page.)

              [4mleft[0m
              [4mtop[0m
              [4mright[0m
              [4mbottom[24m are the coordinates of the box.  The [4mtop[24m and [4mbottom[24m coor‐
                     dinates  are  the  minimum and maximum for the box, since
                     the actual start of the box is [4mgroff[24m’s  drawing  position
                     when  you issue the command, and the bottom of the box is
                     the point where you turn the box “[1moff[22m”.  The top and bot‐
                     tom  coordinates are used only if the box drawing extends
                     onto the next page; ordinarily, they would be set to  the
                     header and footer margins.

              [4mweight[24m provides  the  line  width for the border if “[1mbox[22m” is in‐
                     cluded in the command.

       counterpart.

              [1mject[22m,  [1mKeywords[22m,  or another datum supported by the PDF standard
              or your reader.  [4mfield[24m must be prefixed with a slash.

   [1mImporting graphics[0m
       [4mgropdf[24m supports only the inclusion of other PDF files  for  inline  im‐
       ages.  Such a PDF file may, however, contain any of the graphic formats
       supported by the PDF standard, such as JPEG/JFIF, PNG,  and  GIF.   Any
       application  that outputs PDF can thus be used to prepare files for em‐
       bedding in documents processed by [4mgroff[24m and [4mgropdf[24m.

       The PDF file you wish to insert must be a single page and  the  drawing
       must just fit inside the media size of the PDF file.  In [4minkscape[24m(1) or
       [4mgimp[24m(1), for example, make sure the canvas size just fits the image.

       The PDF parser [4mgropdf[24m implements has not been  rigorously  tested  with
       all applications that produce PDF.  If you find a single‐page PDF which
       fails to import properly, try processing it with the [4mpdftk[24m(1) program.

   [1mTrueType and other font formats[0m
       [4mgropdf[24m does not yet support any font formats besides Adobe Type 1  (PFA
       or PFB).

[1mFont installation[0m
       The following is a step‐by‐step font installation guide for [4mgropdf.[0m

       • Convert  your  font  to something [4mgroff[24m understands.  This is a Post‐
         Script Type 1 font in PFA or PFB format, together with an  AFM  file.
         A PFA file begins as follows.
                %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:
         A  PFB file contains this string as well, preceded by some non‐print‐
         ing bytes.  In the following steps,  we  will  consider  the  use  of
         CTAN’s BrushScriptX‐Italic font in PFA format.

       • Convert  the  AFM  file  to  a  [4mgroff[24m  font description file with the
         [4mafmtodit[24m(1) program.  For instance,
                $ [1mafmtodit BrushScriptX-Italic.afm text.map BSI[0m
         converts the Adobe Font Metric file  [4mBrushScriptX-Italic.afm[24m  to  the
         [4mgroff[24m font description file [4mBSI[24m.

         If  you  have  a  font family which provides regular upright (roman),
         bold,  italic,  and  bold‐italic  styles,  (where  “italic”  may   be
         “oblique”  or “slanted”), we recommend using [1mR[22m, [1mB[22m, [1mI[22m, and [1mBI[22m, respec‐
         tively, as suffixes to the [4mgroff[24m font family name to  enable  [4mgroff[24m’s
         font  family  and  style  selection  features.  An example is [4mgroff[24m’s
         built‐in support for Times: the font family name is abbreviated as [1mT[22m,
         and  the  [4mgroff[24m font names are therefore [1mTR[22m, [1mTB[22m, [1mTI[22m, and [1mTBI[22m.  In our
         example, however, the BrushScriptX font  is  available  in  a  single
         style only, italic.

       • Install  the  [4mgroff[24m font description file(s) in a [4mdevpdf[24m subdirectory
         in the search path that [4mgroff[24m uses for device and font file  descrip‐
         tions.   See  the  [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[24m  entry in section “Environment” of
         [4mtroff[24m(1) for the current value of the font search path.  While  [4mgroff[0m
         doesn’t  directly  use  AFM  files,  it  is a good idea to store them
         alongside its font description files.

       • Register fonts in the [4mdevpdf/download[24m file so they can be located for
         embedding  in  PDF  files  [4mgropdf[24m generates.  Only the first [4mdownload[0m
         file encountered in the font search path is read.  If in doubt,  copy
         the  default  [4mdownload[24m  file (see section “Files” below) to the first
         directory in the font search path and  add  your  fonts  there.   The
         PostScript  font  name  used  by [4mgropdf[24m is stored in the [1minternalname[0m
         field in the [4mgroff[24m font description file.  (This name does not neces‐
         sarily  resemble  the  font’s file name.)  If the font in our example
         had originated from a foundry named [1mZ[22m, we  would  add  the  following
         line to [4mdownload[24m.
                Z→BrushScriptX-Italic→BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa
         A  tab  character,  depicted as →, separates the fields.  The default
         foundry has no name: its field is empty and entries corresponding  to
         it start with a tab character, as will the one in our example.

       • Test the selection and embedding of the new font.
                printf "\\f[BSI]Hello, world!\n" | groff -T pdf -P -e >hello.pdf
                see hello.pdf

[1mEnvironment[0m
       [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[0m
              A  list  of directories in which to seek the selected output de‐
              vice’s directory of device and font description files.   If,  in
              the  [4mdownload[24m file, the font file has been specified with a full
              path,  no  directories   are   searched.    See   [4mtroff[24m(1)   and
              [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       [4mGROPDF_NOSLIDE[0m
              If  set  and evaluates to a true value (to Perl), [4mgropdf[24m ignores
              commands specific to presentation PDFs, producing a  normal  PDF
              instead.

       [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[0m
              A  timestamp  (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to use
              as the output creation timestamp in place of the  current  time.
              The  time  is  converted  to  human‐readable  form  using Perl’s
              [4mlocaltime()[24m function and recorded in a PDF comment.

       [4mTZ[24m     The time zone to use when converting the current time (or  value
              of [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[24m) to human‐readable form; see [4mtzset[24m(3).

[1mDescription[0m
       The GNU [4mroff[24m PostScript output driver translates the output of [4mtroff[24m(1)
       into PostScript.  Normally, [4mgrops[24m is invoked by [4mgroff[24m(1) when the  lat‐
       ter  is given the “[1m-T ps[22m” option.  (In this installation, [1mps [22mis the de‐
       fault output device.)  Use [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-P [22moption to pass any options  shown
       above  to  [4mgrops[24m.   If  no [4mfile[24m arguments are given, or if [4mfile[24m is “-”,
       [4mgrotty[24m reads the standard input stream.  Output is written to the stan‐
       dard output stream.

       When called with multiple [4mfile[24m arguments, [4mgrops[24m doesn’t produce a valid
       document structure (one conforming to the Document Structuring  Conven‐
       tions).   To print such concatenated output, it is necessary to deacti‐
       vate DSC handling in the printing program or previewer.

       See section “Font installation” below for a guide to  installing  fonts
       for [4mgrops[24m.

       [1m-b [4m[22mn[24m   Work around problems with spoolers, previewers, and older print‐
              ers.     Normally,   [4mgrops[24m   produces   output   at   PostScript
              LanguageLevel 2 that conforms to version  3.0  of  the  Document
              Structuring Conventions.  Some software and devices can’t handle
              such a data stream.  The value of [4mn[24m determines what  [4mgrops[24m  does
              to  make  its  output  acceptable to such consumers.  If [4mn[24m is [1m0[22m,
              [4mgrops[24m employs no workarounds, which is the default;  it  can  be
              changed by modifying the [1mbroken [22mdirective in [4mgrops[24m’s [4mDESC[24m file.

              confuse Sun’s [4mpageview[24m previewer.

              Add  4  to  omit  lines in included files beginning with [1m%%Page[22m,

              Sun’s Newsprint with a printer that requires page reversal.

              Add 16 to omit media size information (that is, output neither a

              needed for  older  printers  that  don’t  understand  PostScript
              LanguageLevel  2, and is also necessary if the output is further
              processed to produce an EPS file; see  subsection  “Escapsulated

              The default thickness is [1m40 [22m(0.04 em).

[1mUsage[0m
       The input to [4mgrops[24m must be in the format output by [4mtroff[24m(1),  described
       in  [4mgroff_out[24m(5).   In  addition, the device and font description files
       for the device used must meet certain requirements.  The device resolu‐
       tion must be an integer multiple of 72 times the [1msizescale[22m.  The device
       description file must contain a valid paper format; see  [4mgroff_font[24m(5).
       Each font description file must contain a directive
              internalname [4mpsname[0m
       which says that the PostScript name of the font is [4mpsname[24m.

       A font description file may also contain a directive
              encoding [4menc‐file[0m
       which  says  that the PostScript font should be reencoded using the en‐
       coding described in [4menc‐file[24m; this file should consist of a sequence of
       lines of the form
              [4mpschar[24m [4mcode[0m
       where  [4mpschar[24m  is the PostScript name of the character, and [4mcode[24m is its
       position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer;  valid  values
       are  in  the range 0 to 255.  Lines starting with [1m# [22mand blank lines are
       ignored.  The code for each character given  in  the  font  description
       file must correspond to the code for the character in encoding file, or
       to the code in the default encoding for the font if the PostScript font
       is  not  to be reencoded.  This code can be used with the [1m\N [22mescape se‐
       quence in [4mtroff[24m to select the character, even if it  does  not  have  a
       [4mgroff[24m  glyph  name.   Every character in the font description file must
       exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in the font descrip‐
       tion file must match the widths used in the PostScript font.  [4mgrops[24m as‐
       sumes that a character with a [4mgroff[24m name of [1mspace [22mis  blank  (makes  no
       marks  on  the  page);  it can make use of such a character to generate
       more efficient and compact PostScript output.

       [4mgrops[24m is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript  font;  it  is  not
       limited to 256 of them.  [4menc‐file[24m (or the default encoding if no encod‐
       ing file is specified) just defines the order of glyphs for  the  first
       256  characters; all other glyphs are accessed with additional encoding
       vectors which [4mgrops[24m produces on the fly.

       [4mgrops[24m can embed fonts in a document that are necessary  to  render  it;
       this  is  called “downloading”.  Such fonts must be in PFA format.  Use
       [4mpfbtops[24m(1) to convert a Type 1 font in PFB format.  Downloadable  fonts
       must be listed a [4mdownload[24m file containing lines of the form
              [4mpsname[24m [4mfile[0m
       where  [4mpsname[24m  is the PostScript name of the font, and [4mfile[24m is the name
       of the file containing it; lines beginning with [1m# [22mand blank  lines  are
       ignored; fields may be separated by tabs or spaces.  [4mfile[24m is sought us‐
       ing the same mechanism as that for [4mgroff[24m font description  files.   The
       [4mdownload[24m  file  itself  is also sought using this mechanism; currently,
       only the first matching file found in the device and  font  description
       search path is used.

       If  the  file  containing a downloadable font or imported document con‐
       forms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions, then [4mgrops[24m  inter‐
       prets  any  comments  in  the files sufficiently to ensure that its own
       output is conforming.  It also supplies any needed font resources  that
       are  listed  in the [4mdownload[24m file as well as any needed file resources.
       It is also able to handle inter‐resource  dependencies.   For  example,
       suppose  that  you have a downloadable font called Garamond, and also a
       downloadable font called Garamond‐Outline  which  depends  on  Garamond
       (typically  it would be defined to copy Garamond’s font dictionary, and
       change the PaintType), then it is necessary for Garamond to appear  be‐
       fore  Garamond‐Outline  in the PostScript document.  [4mgrops[24m handles this
       automatically provided that the downloadable font  file  for  Garamond‐
       Outline  indicates  its dependence on Garamond by means of the Document
       Structuring Conventions, for example by beginning  with  the  following
       lines.
              %!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
              %%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
              %%EndComments
              %%IncludeResource: font Garamond
       In  this  case,  both  Garamond  and  Garamond‐Outline would need to be
       listed in the [4mdownload[24m file.  A downloadable font  should  not  include
       its own name in a [1m%%DocumentSuppliedResources [22mcomment.

       [4mgrops[24m  does  not  interpret  [1m%%DocumentFonts [22mcomments.  The [1m%%Document‐[0m
       [1mNeededResources[22m,    [1m%%DocumentSuppliedResources[22m,     [1m%%IncludeResource[22m,

              [1mZCMI   [22mZapfChancery‐MediumItalic

       Special fonts include [1mS[22m, the PostScript Symbol font; [1mZD[22m, Zapf Dingbats;
       [1mSS  [22m(slanted  symbol),  which contains oblique forms of lowercase Greek
       letters derived from Symbol; [1mEURO[22m, which offers a Euro  glyph  for  use
       with  old  devices lacking it; and [1mZDR[22m, a reversed version of ZapfDing‐
       bats (with symbols flipped about the vertical axis).   Most  glyphs  in
       these  fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using [1m\N[22m.  The last three
       are not standard PostScript fonts, but supplied by [4mgroff[24m and  therefore
       included in the default [4mdownload[24m file.

   [1mDevice control commands[0m
       [4mgrops[24m  recognizes device control commands produced by the [1m\X [22mescape se‐
       quence, but interprets only those that begin with a “[1mps:[22m” tag.

       [1m\X'ps: exec [4m[22mcode[24m[1m'[0m
              Execute the arbitrary PostScript commands [4mcode[24m.  The  PostScript
              [4mcurrentpoint[24m  is  set  to the [4mgroff[24m drawing position when the [1m\X[0m
              escape sequence is interpreted before executing [4mcode[24m.  The  ori‐
              gin  is  at  the  top left corner of the page; [4mx[24m coordinates in‐
              crease to the right, and [4my[24m coordinates down the page.  A  proce‐
              dure [1mu [22mis defined that converts [4mgroff[24m basic units to the coordi‐
              nate system in effect (provided  the  user  doesn’t  change  the
              scale).  For example,
                     .nr x 1i
                     \X'ps: exec \nx u 0 rlineto stroke'
              draws a horizontal line one inch long.  [4mcode[24m may make changes to
              the graphics state, but any changes persist only to the  end  of
              the  page.  A dictionary containing the definitions specified by
              the [1mdef [22mand [1mmdef [22mcommands is on top of the dictionary stack.  If
              your  code adds definitions to this dictionary, you should allo‐
              cate space for them using “[1m\X'ps:  mdef  [4m[22mn[24m[1m'[22m”.   Any  definitions
              persist  only  until the end of the page.  If you use the [1m\Y [22mes‐
              cape sequence with an argument that names a macro, [4mcode[24m can  ex‐
              tend over multiple lines.  For example,
                     .nr x 1i
                     .de y
                     ps: exec
                     \nx u 0 rlineto
                     stroke
                     ..
                     \Yy
              is  another  way  to  draw a horizontal line one inch long.  The
              single backslash before “[1mnx[22m”—the only reason to use  a  register
              while  defining the macro “[1my[22m”—is to convert a user‐specified di‐
              mension “[1m1i[22m” to [4mgroff[24m basic units which are in turn converted to
              PostScript units with the [1mu [22mprocedure.

              [4mgrops[24m  wraps  user‐specified  PostScript code into a dictionary,
              nothing more.  In particular, it doesn’t start and end  the  in‐
              serted  code  with [1msave [22mand [1mrestore[22m, respectively.  This must be
              supplied by the user, if necessary.

       [1m\X'ps: file [4m[22mname[24m[1m'[0m
              This is the same as the [1mexec [22mcommand except that the  PostScript
              code is read from file [4mname[24m.

       [1m\X'ps: def [4m[22mcode[24m[1m'[0m
              Place a PostScript definition contained in [4mcode[24m in the prologue.
              There should be at most one definition per [1m\X [22mcommand.  Long de‐
              finitions  can  be  split over several [1m\X [22mcommands; all the [4mcode[0m
              arguments are simply joined together separated by newlines.  The
              definitions  are  placed  in a dictionary which is automatically
              pushed on the dictionary stack when an [1mexec [22mcommand is executed.
              If  you use the [1m\Y [22mescape sequence with an argument that names a
              macro, [4mcode[24m can extend over multiple lines.

       [1m\X'ps: mdef [4m[22mn[24m [4mcode[24m[1m'[0m
              Like [1mdef[22m, except that [4mcode[24m may  contain  up  to  [4mn[24m  definitions.
              [4mgrops[24m  needs  to know how many definitions [4mcode[24m contains so that
              it can create an appropriately sized  PostScript  dictionary  to
              contain them.

              Import  a PostScript graphic from [4mfile[24m.  The arguments [4mllx[24m, [4mlly[24m,
              [4murx[24m, and [4mury[24m give the bounding box of the graphic in the default

              and [4mlly[24m are the [4mx[24m and [4my[24m coordinates of the lower left corner  of
              the  graphic; [4murx[24m and [4mury[24m are the [4mx[24m and [4my[24m coordinates of the up‐
              per right corner of the graphic; [4mwidth[24m and [4mheight[24m  are  integers
              that  give  the desired width and height in [4mgroff[24m basic units of
              the graphic.

              The graphic is scaled so that it has this width and  height  and
              translated  so  that the lower left corner of the graphic is lo‐
              cated at the position associated with [1m\X [22mcommand.  If the height
              argument  is  omitted it is scaled uniformly in the [4mx[24m and [4my[24m axes
              so that it has the specified width.

              The contents of the [1m\X [22mcommand are not interpreted by [4mtroff[24m,  so
              vertical  space  for the graphic is not automatically added, and
              the [4mwidth[24m and [4mheight[24m arguments are not allowed to have  attached
              scaling indicators.

              If  the  PostScript file complies with the Adobe Document Struc‐
              turing Conventions and contains a  [1m%%BoundingBox  [22mcomment,  then
              the  bounding  box  can  be  automatically extracted from within
              [4mgroff[24m input by using the [1mpsbb [22mrequest.

              See [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5) for a description of  the  [1mPSPIC  [22mmacro  which
              provides  a  convenient  high‐level  interface  for inclusion of
              PostScript graphics.

       [1m\X'ps: invis'[0m
       [1m\X'ps: endinvis'[0m
              No output is generated for text and drawing  commands  that  are
              bracketed  with  these [1m\X [22mcommands.  These commands are intended
              for use  when  output  from  [4mtroff[24m  is  previewed  before  being
              processed with [4mgrops[24m; if the previewer is unable to display cer‐
              tain characters or other constructs, then other substitute char‐
              acters  or  constructs  can be used for previewing by bracketing
              them with these [1m\X [22mcommands.

              For example, [4mgxditview[24m is not able to  display  a  proper  [1m\[em][0m
              character because the standard X11 fonts do not provide it; this
              problem can be overcome by executing the following request

                     .char \[em] \X'ps: invis'\
                     \Z'\v'‐.25m'\h'.05m'\D'l .9m 0'\h'.05m''\
                     \X'ps: endinvis'\[em]

              In this case, [4mgxditview[24m is unable to display the [1m\[em] [22mcharacter
              and draws the line, whereas [4mgrops[24m prints the [1m\[em] [22mcharacter and
              ignores the line (this code is already in file  [4mXps.tmac[24m,  which
              is  loaded  if  a  document intended for [4mgrops[24m is previewed with
              [4mgxditview[24m).

       If a PostScript procedure [1mBPhook [22mhas been defined via a  “[1mps:  def[22m”  or
       “[1mps:  mdef[22m”  device control command, it is executed at the beginning of
       every page (before anything is drawn or written by [4mgroff[24m).   For  exam‐
       ple, to underlay the page contents with the word “DRAFT” in light gray,
       you might use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook
              { gsave .9 setgray clippath pathbbox exch 2 copy

              def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       Or, to cause lines and polygons to be drawn with  square  linecaps  and
       mitered  linejoins instead of the round linecaps and linejoins normally
       used by [4mgrops[24m, use
              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook { 2 setlinecap 0 setlinejoin } def
              ..
              .devicem XX
       (square linecaps, as opposed to butt linecaps  (“[1m0  setlinecap[22m”),  give
       true  corners  in  boxed  tables even though the lines are drawn uncon‐
       nected).

   [1mEncapsulated PostScript[0m
       [4mgrops[24m itself doesn’t emit  bounding  box  information.   The  following
       script, [4mgroff2eps[24m, produces an EPS file.

              #! /bin/sh
              groff -P-b16 "$1" > "$1".ps
              gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox -- "$1".ps 2> "$1".bbox
              sed -e "/^%%Orientation/r $1.bbox" \
                  -e "/^%!PS-Adobe-3.0/s/$/ EPSF-3.0/" "$1".ps > "$1".eps
              rm "$1".ps "$1".bbox

       You can then use “[1mgroff2eps foo[22m” to convert file [4mfoo[24m to [4mfoo.eps[24m.

   [1mTrueType and other font formats[0m
       TrueType  fonts  can  be  used with [4mgrops[24m if converted first to Type 42
       format, a PostScript wrapper equivalent to the PFA format described  in
       [4mpfbtops[24m(1).   Several methods exist to generate a Type 42 wrapper; some
       of them involve the use of a  PostScript  interpreter  such  as  Ghost‐
       script—see [4mgs[24m(1).

       One  approach  is to use FontForge, a font editor that can convert most
       outline font formats.  Here’s an example of using the Roboto Slab Serif
       font  with [4mgroff[24m.  Several variables are used so that you can more eas‐
       ily adapt it into your own script.

           MAP=/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/generate/text.map
           TTF=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/roboto/slab/RobotoSlab-Regular.ttf
           BASE=$(basename "$TTF")
           INT=${BASE%.ttf}
           PFA=$INT.pfa
           AFM=$INT.afm
           GFN=RSR
           DIR=$HOME/.local/groff/font
           mkdir -p "$DIR"/devps
           fontforge -lang=ff -c "Open(\"$TTF\");\
           Generate(\"$DIR/devps/$PFA\");"
           afmtodit "$DIR/devps/$AFM" "$MAP" "$DIR/devps/$GFN"
           printf "$BASE\t$PFA\n" >> "$DIR/devps/download"

       [4mfontforge[24m and [4mafmtodit[24m may generate warnings depending on  the  attrib‐
       utes of the font.  The test procedure is simple.

           printf ".ft RSR\nHello, world!\n" | groff -F "$DIR" > hello.ps

       Once you’re satisfied that the font works, you may want to generate any
       available related styles (for instance, Roboto Slab  also  has  “Bold”,
       “Light”, and “Thin” styles) and set up [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[24m in your environ‐
       ment to include the directory you keep the generated fonts in  so  that
       you don’t have to use the [1m-F [22moption.

[1mFont installation[0m
       The following is a step‐by‐step font installation guide for [4mgrops.[0m

       • Convert  your  font  to something [4mgroff[24m understands.  This is a Post‐
         Script Type 1 font in PFA format or a PostScript Type  42  font,  to‐
         gether with an AFM file.  A PFA file begins as follows.
                %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:
         A  PFB file contains this string as well, preceded by some non‐print‐
         ing bytes.  If your font is in PFB  format,  use  [4mgroff[24m’s  [4mpfbtops[24m(1)
         program  to  convert it to PFA.  For TrueType and other font formats,
         we recommend [4mfontforge[24m, which can convert most outline font  formats.
         A Type 42 font file begins as follows.
                %!PS-TrueTypeFont
         This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.  Old PostScript printers
         might not support them (that is, they might not have a built‐in True‐
         Type font interpreter).  In the following steps, we will consider the
         use of CTAN’s BrushScriptX‐Italic font in PFA format.

       • Convert the AFM file to  a  [4mgroff[24m  font  description  file  with  the
         [4mafmtodit[24m(1) program.  For instance,
                $ [1mafmtodit BrushScriptX-Italic.afm text.map BSI[0m
         converts  the  Adobe  Font Metric file [4mBrushScriptX-Italic.afm[24m to the
         [4mgroff[24m font description file [4mBSI[24m.

         If you have a font family which  provides  regular  upright  (roman),
         bold, italic, and bold‐italic styles (where “italic” may be “oblique”
         or “slanted”), we recommend using the letters [1mR[22m, [1mB[22m, [1mI[22m,  and  [1mBI[22m,  re‐
         spectively,  as  suffixes  to  the  [4mgroff[24m  font family name to enable
         [4mgroff[24m’s font family and style  selection  features.   An  example  is
         [4mgroff[24m’s  built‐in support for Times: the font family name is abbrevi‐
         ated as [1mT[22m, and the [4mgroff[24m font names are therefore  [1mTR[22m,  [1mTB[22m,  [1mTI[22m,  and
         [1mTBI[22m.   In our example, however, the BrushScriptX font is available in
         a single style only, italic.

       • Install the [4mgroff[24m font description file(s) in a [4mdevps[24m subdirectory in
         the  search  path  that  [4mgroff[24m uses for device and font file descrip‐
         tions.  See the [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[24m entry  in  section  “Environment”  of
         [4mtroff[24m(1)  for the current value of the font search path.  While [4mgroff[0m
         doesn’t directly use AFM files, it is  a  good  idea  to  store  them
         alongside its font description files.

       • Register  fonts in the [4mdevps/download[24m file so they can be located for
         embedding in PostScript files [4mgrops[24m generates.  Only the first  [4mdown‐[0m
         [4mload[24m  file encountered in the font search path is read.  If in doubt,
         copy the default [4mdownload[24m file (see section  “Files”  below)  to  the
         first  directory  in  the  font search path and add your fonts there.
         The PostScript font name used by [4mgrops[24m is stored in the  [1minternalname[0m
         field in the [4mgroff[24m font description file.  (This name does not neces‐
         sarily resemble the font’s file name.)  We add the following line  to
         [4mdownload[24m.
                BrushScriptX-Italic→BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa
         A tab character, depicted as →, separates the fields.

       • Test the selection and embedding of the new font.
                printf "\\f[BSI]Hello, world!\n" | groff -T ps -P -e >hello.ps
                see hello.pdf

[1mOld fonts[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  versions 1.19.2 and earlier contained descriptions of a slightly
       different set of the base 35 PostScript level 2 fonts defined by Adobe.
       The  older  set  has  229 glyphs and a larger set of kerning pairs; the
       newer one has 314 glyphs and includes the Euro  glyph.   For  backwards
       compatibility,  these  old  font descriptions are also installed in the
       [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/oldfont/devps[24m directory.

       To use them, make sure that [4mgrops[24m finds the fonts  before  the  default
       system  fonts  (with the same names): either give [4mgrops[24m the [1m-F [22mcommand‐
       line option,
              $ [1mgroff -Tps -P-F -P/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/oldfont [22m...
       or add the directory to [4mgroff[24m’s font and device description search path
       environment variable,
              $ [1mGROFF_FONT_PATH=/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/oldfont \[0m
                     [1mgroff -Tps [22m...
       when the command runs.

[1mEnvironment[0m
       [4mGROFF_FONT_PATH[0m
              A  list  of directories in which to seek the selected output de‐
              vice’s directory of device  and  font  description  files.   See
              [4mtroff[24m(1) and [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       [4mGROPS_PROLOGUE[0m
              If this is set to [4mfoo[24m, then [4mgrops[24m uses the file [4mfoo[24m (in the font
              path) instead of the default prologue file [4mprologue[24m.  The option
              [1m-P [22moverrides this environment variable.

       [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[0m
              A  timestamp  (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to use
              as the output creation timestamp in place of the  current  time.
              The  time is converted to human‐readable form using [4mctime[24m(3) and
              recorded in a PostScript comment.

       [4mTZ[24m     The time zone to use when converting the current time (or  value
              of [4mSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH[24m) to human‐readable form; see [4mtzset[24m(3).

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m  TTY (“Teletype”) output driver translates the output of
       [4mtroff[24m(1) into a form suitable for  typewriter‐like  devices,  including
       terminal  emulators.   Normally, [4mgrotty[24m is invoked by [4mgroff[24m(1) when the
       latter is given one of  the  “[1m-T  ascii[22m”,  “[1m-T  latin1[22m”,  [1m-Tlatin1[22m,  or
       “[1m-T utf8[22m” options on systems using ISO character encoding standards, or
       with “[1m-T cp1047[22m” or “[1m-T utf8[22m” on EBCDIC‐based hosts.  (In this  instal‐
       lation,  [1mps  [22mis  the  default output device.)  Use [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-P [22moption to
       pass any options shown above to  [4mgrotty[24m.   If  no  [4mfile[24m  arguments  are
       given, or if [4mfile[24m is “-”, [4mgrotty[24m reads the standard input stream.  Out‐
       put is written to the standard output stream.

       By default, [4mgrotty[24m emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429, popularly
       called  “ANSI escapes”) to change text attributes (bold, italic, under‐
       line, reverse video [“negative image”] and colors).  Devices supporting
       the appropriate sequences can view [4mroff[24m documents using eight different
       background and foreground colors.  Following ISO  6429,  the  following
       colors are defined in [4mtty.tmac[24m: black, white, red, green, blue, yellow,
       magenta, and cyan.  Unrecognized  colors  are  mapped  to  the  default
       color,  which  is dependent on the settings of the terminal.  OSC 8 hy‐
       perlinks are produced for these devices.

       In keeping with long‐standing practice and the rarity of terminals (and
       emulators)  that  support  oblique  or italic fonts, italicized text is
       represented with underlining by default—but see the [1m-i [22moption below.

   [1mSGR and OSC support in pagers[0m
       When paging [4mgrotty[24m’s output with [4mless[24m(1), the latter  program  must  be
       instructed  to pass SGR and OSC sequences through to the device; its [1m-R[0m
       option is one way to achieve this ([4mless[24m version 566  or  later  is  re‐
       quired  for  OSC  8  support).  Consequently, programs like [4mman[24m(1) that
       page [4mroff[24m documents with [4mless[24m must call it with an appropriate option.

   [1mLegacy output format[0m
       The [1m-c [22moption tells [4mgrotty[24m to use an output format compatible with  pa‐
       per terminals, like the Teletype machines for which [4mroff[24m and [4mnroff[24m were
       first developed but which are no longer in wide use.   SGR  escape  se‐
       quences  are  not  emitted; bold, italic, and underlining character at‐
       tributes are thus not manipulated.  Instead, [4mgrotty[24m overstrikes, repre‐
       senting a bold character [4mc[24m with the sequence “[4mc[24m BACKSPACE [4mc[24m”, an italic
       character [4mc[24m with the sequence “[1m_ [22mBACKSPACE [4mc[24m”, and  bold  italics  with
       “[1m_  [22mBACKSPACE  [4mc[24m  BACKSPACE [4mc[24m”.  This rendering is inherently ambiguous
       when the character [4mc[24m is itself the underscore.

       The legacy output format can be rendered on a video terminal (or emula‐
       tor)  by  piping  [4mgrotty[24m’s  output through [4mul[24m(1), which may render bold
       italics as reverse video.  Some implementations  of  [4mmore[24m(1)  are  also
       able  to  display these sequences; you may wish to experiment with that
       command’s [1m-b [22moption.  [4mless[24m renders legacy bold and italics without  re‐
       quiring  options.   In  contrast to the terminal output drivers of some
       other [4mroff[24m implementations, [4mgrotty[24m never outputs  reverse  line  feeds.
       There is therefore no need to filter its output through [4mcol[24m(1).

   [1mDevice control commands[0m
       [4mgrotty[24m  understands one device control function produced by the [4mroff[24m [1m\X[0m
       escape sequence in a document.

       [1m\X'tty: link [22m[[4muri[24m [[4mkey[24m[1m=[4m[22mvalue[24m] ...][1m'[0m
              Embed a hyperlink using the  OSC  8  terminal  escape  sequence.
              Specifying [4muri[24m starts hyperlinked text, and omitting it ends the
              hyperlink.  When  [4muri[24m  is  present,  any  number  of  additional
              key/value  pairs  can  be specified; their interpretation is the
              responsibility of the pager or terminal.  Spaces or tabs  cannot
              appear literally in [4muri[24m, [4mkey[24m, or [4mvalue[24m; they must be represented
              in an alternate form.

   [1mDevice description files[0m
       If the [4mDESC[24m file for the character encoding contains the “[1municode[22m”  di‐
       rective, [4mgrotty[24m emits Unicode characters in UTF‐8 encoding.  Otherwise,
       it emits characters in a single‐byte encoding depending on the data  in
       the font description files.  See [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       A  font description file may contain a directive “[1minternalname [4m[22mn[24m” where
       [4mn[24m is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in [4mn[24m is set, then  the  font  is
       treated  as an italic font; if the 02 bit is set, then it is treated as
       a bold font.

   [1mTypefaces[0m
       [4mgrotty[24m supports the standard four styles:  [1mR  [22m(roman),  [1mI  [22m([4mitalic[24m),  [1mB[0m
       ([1mbold[22m),  and  [1mBI  [22m([4m[1mbold‐italic[24m[22m).  Because the output driver operates in
       [4mnroff[24m mode, attempts to set or change the font family or type size  are
       ignored.

[1mLimitations[0m
       [4mgrotty[24m is intended only for simple documents.

       • There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical motions.

       • [4mroff[24m [1m\D [22mescape sequences producing anything other than horizontal and
         vertical lines are not supported.

       • Characters above the first line (that is, with a vertical drawing po‐
         sition of 0) cannot be rendered.

       • Color handling differs from other output drivers.  The [4mgroff[24m requests
         and escape sequences that set the stroke and fill colors instead  set
         the foreground and background character cell colors, respectively.

[1mExamples[0m
       The  following [4mgroff[24m document exercises several features for which out‐
       put device support varies:  (1)  bold  style;  (2)  italic  (underline)
       style; (3) bold‐italic style; (4) character composition by overstriking
       (“coöperate”); (5) foreground color; (6) background color; and (7) hor‐
       izontal and vertical line‐drawing.

              You might see \f[B]bold\f[] and \f[I]italic\f[].
              Some people see \f[BI]both\f[].
              If the output device does (not) co\z\[ad]operate,
              you might see \m[red]red\m[].

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mhpftodit[24m creates a font description file for use with a Hewlett‐Packard
       LaserJet 4‐series (or newer) printer with the [4mgrolj4[24m(1)  output  driver
       of [4mgroff[24m(1), using data from an HP tagged font metric (TFM) file.  [4mtfm‐[0m
       [4mfile[24m is the name of the font’s TFM file; Intellifont and  TrueType  TFM
       files  are  supported, but symbol set TFM files are not.  [4mmap‐file[24m is a
       file giving the [4mgroff[24m special character identifiers for glyphs  in  the
       font; this file should consist of a sequence of lines of the form
              [4mm[24m [4mu[24m [4mc1[24m [4mc2[24m ... [# [4mcomment[24m]
       where  [4mm[24m  is  a  decimal  integer giving the glyph’s MSL (Master Symbol
       List) number, [4mu[24m is a hexadecimal integer giving its  Unicode  character
       code, and [4mc1[24m, [4mc2[24m, ...  are its [4mgroff[24m glyph names (see [4mgroff_char[24m(7) for
       a list).  The values can be separated by any number  of  spaces  and/or
       tabs.  The Unicode value must use uppercase hexadecimal digits A–F, and
       must lack a leading “[1m0x[22m”, “[1mu[22m”, or “[1mU+[22m”.  Unicode  values  corresponding
       to   composite   glyphs   are   decomposed;  that  is  “[1mu00C0[22m”  becomes
       “[1mu0041_0300[22m”.  A glyph without a [4mgroff[24m special character identifier may
       be  named  [1mu[4m[22mXXXX[24m  if the glyph corresponds to a Unicode value, or as an
       unnamed glyph “[1m---[22m”.  If the given Unicode value is in the Private  Use
       Area  (PUA) (0xE000–0xF8FF), the glyph is included as an unnamed glyph.
       Refer to [4mgroff_diff[24m(1) for additional information about unnamed  glyphs
       and how to access them.

       Blank  lines and lines beginning with “[1m#[22m” are ignored.  A “[1m#[22m” following
       one or more [4mgroff[24m names begins a comment.  Because “[1m#[22m” is a valid [4mgroff[0m
       name, it must appear first in a list of [4mgroff[24m names if a comment is in‐
       cluded, as in
              3   0023   #   # number sign
       or
              3   0023   # sh   # number sign
       whereas in
              3   0023   sh #   # number sign
       the first “[1m#[22m” is interpreted as the beginning of the comment.

       Output is written in [4mgroff_font[24m(5) format to [4mfont‐description,[24m  a  file
       named  for  the  intended  [4mgroff[24m font name; if this operand is “[1m-[22m”, the
       font description is written to the standard output stream.

       If the [1m-i [22moption is  used,  [4mhpftodit[24m  automatically  will  generate  an
       italic correction, a left italic correction, and a subscript correction
       for each glyph (the significance of these parameters  is  explained  in
       [4mgroff_font[24m(5)).

              This  option provides a simple means of adding Unicode‐named and
              unnamed glyphs to a font without including them in the map file,
              but  it affords little control over which glyphs are placed in a
              regular font and which are placed in a special font.  The  pres‐
              ence or absence of the [1m-s [22moption has some effect on which glyphs
              are included: without  it,  only  the  “text”  symbol  sets  are
              searched  for  matching glyphs; with it, only the “mathematical”
              symbol sets are searched.  Nonetheless, restricting  the  symbol
              sets  searched  isn’t  very  selective—many glyphs are placed in
              both regular and special fonts.  Normally,  [1m-a  [22mshould  be  used
              only as a last resort.

       [1m-d     [22mDump  information  about  the  TFM  file  to the standard output
              stream; use this to ensure that a TFM file is a proper match for
              a font, and that its contents are suitable.  The information in‐
              cludes the values of important TFM tags and a  listing  (by  MSL
              number  for  Intellifont TFM files or by Unicode value for True‐
              Type TFM files) of the glyphs included in  the  TFM  file.   The
              unit of measure “DU” for some tags indicates design units; there
              are 8782 design units per em for Intellifont fonts, and 2048 de‐
              sign units per em for TrueType fonts.  Note that the accessibil‐
              ity of a glyph depends on its inclusion in a  symbol  set;  some
              TFM files list many glyphs but only a few symbol sets.

              The  glyph listing includes the glyph index within the TFM file,
              the MSL or Unicode value, and the symbol set and character  code
              that  will  be  used  to print the glyph.  If [4mmap‐file[24m is given,
              [4mgroff[24m names are given for matching glyphs.  If  only  the  glyph
              index and MSL or Unicode value are given, the glyph does not ap‐
              pear in any supported symbol set and cannot be printed.

              With the [1m-d [22moption, [4mmap‐file[24m is optional, and [4moutput‐font[24m is ig‐
              nored if given.

       [1m-i [4m[22mn[24m   Generate  an  italic correction for each glyph so that its width
              plus its italic correction is equal to [4mn[24m thousandths  of  an  em
              plus the amount by which the right edge of the glyphs’s bounding
              box is to the right of its origin.  If a negative italic correc‐
              tion would result, use a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x‐height
              of  the font.  If a subscript correction greater than the italic
              correction would result, use a subscript correction equal to the
              italic correction instead.

              Also generate a left italic correction for each glyph equal to [4mn[0m
              thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left  edge  of
              the  glyphs’s  bounding  box  is to the left of its origin.  The
              left italic correction may be negative.

              This option normally is  needed  only  with  italic  or  oblique
              fonts; a value of 50 (0.05 em) usually is a reasonable choice.

       [1m-q     [22mSuppress  warnings  about  glyphs  in the map file that were not
              found in the TFM file.  Warnings never  are  given  for  unnamed
              glyphs  or by glyphs named by their Unicode values.  This option
              is useful when sending the output of [4mhpftodit[24m  to  the  standard
              output stream.

       [1m-s     [22mAdd  the [1mspecial [22mdirective to the font description file, affect‐
              ing the order in which HP symbol  sets  are  searched  for  each
              glyph.  Without this option, the “text” sets are searched before
              the “mathematical” symbol sets.  With it, the  search  order  is
              reversed.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mindxbib[24m makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in each
       [4mfile[24m for use with [4mrefer[24m(1), [4mlookbib[24m(1), and [4mlkbib[24m(1).  Each created in‐
       dex  is named file[4m.i[24m; writing is done to a temporary file which is then
       renamed to this.  If no [4mfile[24m operands are given on the command line be‐
       cause the [1m-f [22moption has been used, and no [1m-o [22moption is given, the index
       will be named [4mInd.i[24m.

       Bibliographic databases  are  divided  into  records  by  blank  lines.
       Within  a record, each field starts with a [1m% [22mcharacter at the beginning
       of a line.  Fields have a one letter name that follows the [1m% [22mcharacter.

       The values set by the [1m-c[22m, [1m-l[22m, [1m-n[22m, and [1m-t [22moptions are stored in the  in‐
       dex:  when  the index is searched, keys will be discarded and truncated
       in a manner appropriate to these options; the  original  keys  will  be
       used  for verifying that any record found using the index actually con‐
       tains the keys.  This means that a user  of  an  index  need  not  know
       whether  these options were used in the creation of the index, provided
       that not all the keys to be searched for would have been discarded dur‐
       ing  indexing  and that the user supplies at least the part of each key
       that would have remained after being truncated  during  indexing.   The
       value set by the [1m-i [22moption is also stored in the index and will be used
       in verifying records found using the index.

       [1m-d [4m[22mdir[24m Use [4mdir[24m as the name of the directory to store in the index,  in‐
              stead  of  that returned by [4mgetcwd[24m(2).  Typically, [4mdir[24m will be a
              symbolic link whose target is the current working directory.

       [1m-f [4m[22mlist‐file[0m
              Read the files to be indexed from [4mlist‐file[24m.  If [4mlist‐file[24m is [1m-[22m,
              files  will  be read from the standard input stream.  The [1m-f [22mop‐

       [1m-h [4m[22mmin‐hash‐table‐size[0m
              Use the first prime number greater than or equal to the argument
              for the size of the hash table.  Larger values will usually make
              searching faster, but will make the index file larger and  cause
              [4mindxbib[24m to use more memory.  The default hash table size is 997.

       [1m-i [4m[22mexcluded‐fields[0m
              Don’t  index the contents of fields whose names are in [4mexcluded‐[0m

              not present, [4mindxbib[24m excludes fields [1mX[22m, [1mY[22m, and [1mZ[22m.

       [1m-k [4m[22mmax‐keys‐per‐record[0m
              Use  no  more  keys per input record than specified in the argu‐
              ment.  If this option is not present, the maximum is 100.

       [1m-l [4m[22mmin‐key‐length[0m
              Discard any key whose length in characters is shorter  than  the
              value of the argument.  If this option is not present, the mini‐
              mum key length is 3.

       [1m-n [4m[22mthreshold[0m
              Discard the [4mthreshold[24m most common words from  the  common  words
              file.   If this option is not present, the 100 most common words
              are discarded.

       [1m-o [4m[22mbasename[0m

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mmmroff[24m  is  a simple wrapper for [4mgroff[24m, used to expand cross references
       in [4mmm[24m; see [4mgroff_mm[24m(7).  It runs [4mgroff[24m with the [1m-mm [22moption twice, first
       with  [1m-z  [22mand  [1m-rRef=1 [22mto populate cross‐reference and index files with
       their corresponding entries, and then again to  produce  the  document.
       It  also handles the inclusion of PostScript images with the [1mPIC [22mmacro.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mnroff[24m formats documents written in  the  [4mgroff[24m(7)  language  for  type‐
       writer‐like devices such as terminal emulators.  GNU [4mnroff[24m emulates the
       AT&T  [4mnroff[24m  command  using  [4mgroff[24m(1).   [4mnroff[24m  generates  output   via
       [4mgrotty[24m(1),  [4mgroff[24m’s  terminal  output  driver,  which needs to know the
       character encoding scheme used by the device.  Consequently, acceptable
       arguments  to  the  [1m-T  [22moption are [1mascii[22m, [1mlatin1[22m, [1mutf8[22m, and [1mcp1047[22m; any
       others are ignored.  If neither the [4mGROFF_TYPESETTER[24m environment  vari‐
       able  nor  the  [1m-T [22mcommand‐line option (which overrides the environment
       variable) specifies a (valid) device, [4mnroff[24m consults the locale to  se‐
       lect  an  appropriate output device.  It first tries the [4mlocale[24m(1) pro‐
       gram, then checks several  locale‐related  environment  variables;  see
       section  “Environment” below.  If all of the foregoing fail, [1m-Tascii [22mis

       addition,  this  implementation  ignores the AT&T [4mnroff[24m options [1m-e[22m, [1m-q[22m,
       and [1m-s [22m(which are not implemented in [4mgroff[24m).  The options [1m-k[22m,  [1m-K[22m,  [1m-p[22m,

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mpdfmom[24m is a wrapper around [4mgroff[24m(1) that facilitates the production  of
       PDF documents from files formatted with the [4mmom[24m macros.

       [4mpdfmom[24m  prints  to the standard output, so output must usually be redi‐
       rected to a destination file.  The size of the final PDF can be reduced
       by piping the output through [4mps2pdf[24m(1).

       If  called  with  the  [1m-Tpdf  [22moption  (which  is  the  default), [4mpdfmom[0m
       processes files using [4mgroff[24m’s native PDF driver, [4mgropdf[24m(1).  If [1m-Tps [22mis
       given,  processing  is passed over to [4mpdfroff[24m, which uses [4mgroff[24m’s Post‐
       Script driver.  In either case, multiple runs of the  source  file  are
       performed in order to satisfy any forward references in the document.

       [4mpdfmom[24m  accepts  all  the same options as [4mgroff[24m.  If [1m-Tps [22mis given, the
       options associated with [4mpdfroff[24m are  accepted  as  well.   When  [4mpdfmom[0m
       calls  [4mpdfroff[24m,  the  options “[1m-mpdfmark -mom --no-toc[22m” options are im‐
       plied and should not be given on the command line.  Equally, it is  not
       necessary to supply the [1m-mom [22mor [1m-m mom [22moptions when [1m-Tps [22mis absent.

       PDF  integration with the [4mmom[24m macros is discussed in full in the manual
       “Producing PDFs with [4mgroff[24m and [4mmom[24m”, which  was  itself  produced  with
       [4mpdfmom[24m.

       If called with the [1m-v [22mor [1m--version [22moptions, [4mpdfmom[24m displays its version
       information and exits.

       [1m-T[22m, and [1m-v[22m; see section “Usage” below.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mpdfroff[24m is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system, [4mgroff[24m.
       It  transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass [4mgroff[24m process‐
       ing, when applied to suitably marked up [4mgroff[24m source files,  such  that
       tables of contents and body text are formatted separately, and are sub‐
       sequently combined in the correct order, for  final  publication  as  a
       single  PDF  document.   A further optional “style sheet” capability is
       provided; this allows for the definition of content which  is  required
       to precede the table of contents, in the published document.

       For  each  invocation  of  [4mpdfroff[24m, the ultimate [4mgroff[24m output stream is
       post‐processed by the Ghostscript [4mgs[24m(1) interpreter to produce  a  fin‐
       ished PDF document.

       [4mpdfroff[24m makes no assumptions about, and imposes no restrictions on, the
       use of any [4mgroff[24m macro packages which the user may choose to employ, in
       order  to  achieve  a desired document format; however, it [4mdoes[24m include
       specific built in support for the [4mpdfmark[24m  macro  package,  should  the
       user  choose to employ it.  Specifically, if the [4mpdfhref[24m macro, defined
       in the [4mpdfmark.tmac[24m package, is used to define public reference  marks,
       or dynamic links to such reference marks, then [4mpdfroff[24m performs as many
       preformatting [4mgroff[24m passes as required, up to a maximum limit of  [4mfour[24m,
       in  order to compile a document reference dictionary, to resolve refer‐
       ences, and to expand the dynamically defined content of links.

[1mUsage[0m
       The command line is parsed in accordance with normal  GNU  conventions,
       but  with  one exception—when specifying any short form option (i.e., a
       single character option introduced by a single hyphen), and if that op‐
       tion  expects  an  argument,  then  it  [4mmust[24m be specified independently
       (i.e., it may [4mnot[24m be appended to any group of  other  single  character
       short form options).

       Long  form option names (i.e., those introduced by a double hyphen) may
       be abbreviated to their minimum length unambiguous initial substring.

       Otherwise, [4mpdfroff[24m usage closely mirrors that of [4mgroff[24m itself.  Indeed,
       with  the  exception  of the [1m-h[22m, [1m-v[22m, and [1m-T [4m[22mdev[24m short form options, and
       all long form options, which are parsed internally by [4mpdfroff[24m, all  op‐
       tions  and file name arguments specified on the command line are passed
       on to [4mgroff[24m, to control the formatting of  the  PDF  document.   Conse‐
       quently,  [4mpdfroff[24m  accepts  all  options and arguments, as specified in
       [4mgroff[24m(1), which may also be considered as the definitive reference  for
       all standard [4mpdfroff[24m options and argument usage.

[1mOptions[0m
       [4mpdfroff[24m  accepts  all of the short form options (i.e., those introduced
       by a single hyphen), which are available with [4mgroff[24m  itself.   In  most
       cases,  these  are simply passed transparently to [4mgroff[24m; the following,
       however, are handled specially by [4mpdfroff[24m.

       [1m-h     [22mSame as [1m--help[22m; see below.

       [1m-i     [22mProcess standard input, after all other specified  input  files.
              This  is  passed  transparently  to  [4mgroff[24m, but, if grouped with
              other options, it [4mmust[24m be the first in  the  group.   Hiding  it
              within  a  group breaks standard input processing, in the multi‐

       See  [4mgroff[24m(1)  for a description of all other short form options, which
       are transparently passed through [4mpdfroff[24m to [4mgroff[24m.

       All long form options (i.e., those introduced by a double  hyphen)  are
       interpreted locally by [4mpdfroff[24m; they are [4mnot[24m passed on to [4mgroff[24m, unless
       otherwise stated below.

       [1m--emit-ps[0m
              Suppresses  the final output conversion step, causing [4mpdfroff[24m to
              emit PostScript output instead of PDF.  This may  be  useful  to
              capture  intermediate PostScript output when using a specialised
              postprocessor, such as [4mgpresent[24m for example, in place of the de‐
              fault Ghostscript PDF writer.

       [1m--keep-temporary-files[0m
              Suppresses  the  deletion of temporary files, which normally oc‐
              curs after [4mpdfroff[24m has completed PDF document  formatting;  this
              may be useful when debugging formatting problems.

              See  section  “Files”  below  for a description of the temporary
              files used by [4mpdfroff[24m.

              scribed  below) to eliminate the overhead of PDF formatting when
              running [4mpdfroff[24m to create a reference dictionary for  use  in  a
              different document.

       [1m--no-reference-dictionary[0m
              May  be  used  to eliminate the overhead of creating a reference
              dictionary, when it is known that the target PDF  document  con‐
              tains no public references, created by the [1mpdfhref [22mmacro.

       [1m--no-toc-relocation[0m
              May  be used to eliminate the extra [4mgroff[24m processing pass, which
              is required to generate a table of contents, and relocate it  to
              the  start  of  the  PDF  document, when processing any document
              which lacks an automatically generated table of contents.

       [1m--no-kill-null-pages[0m
              While preparing for simulation of  the  manual  collation  step,
              which  is traditionally required to relocate a [4mtable[24m [4mof[24m [4mcontents[0m
              to the start of a document,  [4mpdfroff[24m  accumulates  a  number  of
              empty  page descriptions into the intermediate PostScript output
              stream.  During the final collation step, these empty pages  are
              normally  discarded  from  the  finished  document;  this option
              forces [4mpdfroff[24m to leave them in place.

       [1m--pdf-output=[4m[22mname[0m
              Specifies the name to be used for the resultant PDF document; if
              unspecified,  the  PDF  output is written to standard output.  A
              future version of [4mpdfroff[24m may use this  option,  to  encode  the
              document name in a generated reference dictionary.

       [1m--reference-dictionary=[4m[22mname[0m
              Specifies  the  name to be used for the generated reference dic‐
              tionary file; if unspecified, the reference dictionary  is  cre‐
              ated  in  a  temporary  file, which is deleted when [4mpdfroff[24m com‐
              pletes processing of the current document.  This option [4mmust[24m  be
              specified,  if  it  is desired to save the reference dictionary,
              for use in references placed in other PDF documents.

       [1m--report-progress[0m
              Causes [4mpdfroff[24m to display an informational message  on  standard
              error, at the start of each [4mgroff[24m processing pass.

       [1m--stylesheet=[4m[22mname[0m
              Specifies the name of an [4minput[24m [4mfile[24m, to be used as a style sheet
              for formatting of content, which is to be placed [4mbefore[24m the  ta‐
              ble of contents, in the formatted PDF document.

       [1m--version[0m
              Causes [4mpdfroff[24m to display a version identification message.  The
              entire command line is then passed transparently to [4mgroff[24m, in  a
              [4mone[24m  pass  operation  [4monly[24m,  in  order to display the associated
              [4mgroff[24m version information, before exiting.

[1mEnvironment[0m
       The following environment variables may be set, and exported, to modify
       the behaviour of [4mpdfroff[24m.

       [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[0m
              Specifies  the  program to be used for collation of the finished
              PDF document.

              This collation step may be required to move [4mtables[24m  [4mof[24m  [4mcontents[0m
              to  the start of the finished PDF document, when formatting with
              traditional macro packages, which print them at the  end.   How‐
              ever, users should not normally need to specify [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m,
              (and indeed, are not encouraged  to  do  so).   If  unspecified,
              [4mpdfroff[24m uses [4msed[24m(1) by default, which normally suffices.

              If  [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m  [4mis[24m specified, then it must act as a filter,
              accepting a list of file name arguments, and write its output to
              the   standard   output  stream,  whence  it  is  piped  to  the
              [4mPDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND[24m, to produce the finished PDF  out‐
              put.

              When  specifying  [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m,  it  is normally necessary to
              also specify [4mPDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES[24m.

              [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m is ignored,  if  [4mpdfroff[24m  is  invoked  with  the
              [1m--no-kill-null-pages [22moption.

       [4mPDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES[0m
              Specifies options to be passed to the [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m program.

              It    should    not    normally    be   necessary   to   specify
              [4mPDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES[24m.   The  internal  default  is  a  [4msed[24m(1)
              script,  which is intended to remove completely blank pages from
              the collated output stream, and which should be  appropriate  in
              most  applications  of  [4mpdfroff[24m.  However, if any alternative to
              [4msed[24m(1) is specified for [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m, then it is likely  that
              a      corresponding      alternative      specification     for
              [4mPDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES[24m is required.

              As in the case of  [4mPDFROFF_COLLATE[24m,  [4mPDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES[24m  is
              ignored, if [4mpdfroff[24m is invoked with the [1m--no-kill-null-pages [22mop‐
              tion.

       [4mPDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND[0m
              Specifies the command to be used for the final document  conver‐
              sion from PostScript intermediate output to PDF.  It must behave
              as a filter, writing its output to the standard  output  stream,
              and must accept an arbitrary number of [4mfiles[24m [4m...[24m arguments, with
              the special case of “[1m-[22m” representing the standard input stream.

              If unspecified, [4mPDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND[24m defaults to
                   gs -dBATCH -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
                        -sOutputFile=-

       [4mGROFF_TMPDIR[0m
              Identifies the directory in which [4mpdfroff[24m should  create  tempo‐
              rary  files.   If  [4mGROFF_TMPDIR[24m is [4mnot[24m specified, then the vari‐
              ables [4mTMPDIR[24m, [4mTMP[24m and [4mTEMP[24m are considered in  turn  as  possible
              temporary  file  repositories.   If  none of these are set, then
              temporary files are created in the current directory.

       [4mGROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER[0m
              Specifies the program to be invoked when [4mpdfroff[24m converts  [4mgroff[0m
              PostScript  output  to PDF.  If [4mPDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND[24m is
              specified, then the command name it specifies is [4mimplicitly[24m  as‐
              signed to [4mGROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER[24m, overriding any explicit
              setting     specified     in      the      environment.       If
              [4mGROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER[24m  is  not  specified,  then [4mpdfroff[0m
              searches the process [4mPATH[24m, looking for a program with any of the
              well  known  names for the Ghostscript interpreter; if no Ghost‐
              script interpreter can be found, [4mpdfroff[24m aborts.

       [4mGROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER[0m
              Specifies the program to be invoked when [4mpdfroff[24m  is  extracting
              reference  dictionary  entries from a [4mgroff[24m intermediate message
              stream.  If [4mGROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER[24m is not specified, then [4mpdfroff[0m
              searches the process [4mPATH[24m, looking for any of the preferred pro‐
              grams, [4mgawk[24m, [4mmawk[24m, [4mnawk[24m, and [4mawk[24m, in  that  order;  if  none  of
              these  are found, [4mpdfroff[24m issues a warning message, and continue
              processing; however, in this case, no  reference  dictionary  is
              created.

       [4mOSTYPE[24m Typically  defined automatically by the operating system, [4mOSTYPE[0m
              is used on Microsoft Win32/MS‐DOS platforms [4monly[24m, to  infer  the
              default [4mPATH_SEPARATOR[24m character, which is used when parsing the
              process [4mPATH[24m to search for external helper programs.

       [4mPATH_SEPARATOR[0m
              If set, [4mPATH_SEPARATOR[24m overrides the default  separator  charac‐
              ter,  (‘:’  on  POSIX/Unix  systems, inferred from [4mOSTYPE[24m on Mi‐
              crosoft Win32/MS‐DOS), which is used when  parsing  the  process
              [4mPATH[24m to search for external helper programs.

       [4mSHOW_PROGRESS[0m
              If this is set to a non‐empty value, then [4mpdfroff[24m always behaves
              as if the [1m--report-progress [22moption is specified on  the  command
              line.

[1mFiles[0m
       Input  and  output files for [4mpdfroff[24m may be named according to any con‐
       vention of the user’s choice.  Typically, input files may be named  ac‐
       cording  to the choice of the principal normatting macro package, e.g.,
       file[4m.ms[24m might be an input file  for  formatting  using  the  [4mms[24m  macros
       ([4ms.tmac[24m); normally, the final output file should be named file[4m.pdf[24m.

       Temporary  files created by [4mpdfroff[24m are placed in the file system hier‐
       archy, in or below the directory  specified  by  environment  variables
       (see  section  “Environment”  above).  If [4mmktemp[24m(1) is available, it is
       invoked to create a private subdirectory  of  the  nominated  temporary
       files  directory,  (with  subdirectory  name  derived from the template
       [4mpdfroff-XXXXXXXXXX[24m); if this subdirectory is successfully created,  the
       temporary files will be placed within it, otherwise they will be placed
       directly in the directory nominated in the environment.

       All temporary files themselves are named according  to  the  convention
       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.[24m*,  where  [4m$$[24m  is  the  standard  shell variable representing the
       process identifier of the [4mpdfroff[24m process itself, and [4m*[24m represents  any
       of  the  extensions used by [4mpdfroff[24m to identify the following temporary
       and intermediate files.

       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.tmp[0m
              A scratch pad file, used to capture reference  data  emitted  by
              [4mgroff[24m, during the [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[24m compilation phase.

       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.ref[0m
              The  [4mreference[24m  [4mdictionary[24m, as compiled in the last but one pass
              of the [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[24m compilation phase; (at the start  of
              the  first  pass,  this  file  is  created  empty; in successive
              passes, it contains the [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[24m  entries,  as  col‐
              lected in the preceding pass).

              If the [1m--reference-dictionary[22m=[4mname[24m option is specified, this in‐
              termediate file becomes permanent, and  is  named  [4mname[24m,  rather
              than [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.ref[24m.

       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.cmp[0m
              Used  to  collect [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[24m entries during the active
              pass of the [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[24m compilation phase.  At the  end
              of any pass, when the content of [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.cmp[24m compares as identical
              to  [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.ref[24m,  (or  the  corresponding  file   named   by   the
              [1m--reference-dictionary[22m=[4mname[24m  option),  then [4mreference[24m [4mdictionary[0m
              compilation is terminated, and the [4mdocument[24m [4mreference[24m [4mmap[24m is ap‐
              pended  to  this  intermediate  file, for inclusion in the final
              formatting passes.

       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.tc[0m
              An intermediate [4mPostScript[24m file, in which  “Table  of  Contents”
              entries  are collected, to facilitate relocation before the body
              text, on ultimate output to the [4mGhostscript[24m postprocessor.

       [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.ps[0m
              An intermediate [4mPostScript[24m file, in which the body text is  col‐
              lected  prior  to ultimate output to the [4mGhostscript[24m postproces‐
              sor, in the proper sequence, [4mafter[24m [4mpdf[24m$$[4m.tc[24m.

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU implementation of [4mpic[24m is part of the [4mgroff[24m(1) document format‐
       ting system.  [4mpic[24m is a [4mtroff[24m(1) preprocessor that  translates  descrip‐
       tions  of  diagrammatic pictures embedded in [4mroff[24m(7) or TeX input files
       into the language understood by TeX or [4mtroff[24m.  It copies  the  contents
       of  each  [4mfile[24m to the standard output stream, except that lines between
       [1m.PS [22mand any of [1m.PE[22m, [1m.PF[22m, or [1m.PY [22mare interpreted as picture descriptions
       in  the  [4mpic[24m language.  End a [4mpic[24m picture with [1m.PE [22mto leave the drawing
       position at the bottom of the picture, and with [1m.PF [22mor [1m.PY [22mto leave  it
       at  the  top.   Normally, [4mpic[24m is not executed directly by the user, but
       invoked by specifying the [1m-p [22moption to [4mgroff[24m(1).  If no  [4mfile[24m  operands
       are  given  on  the command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, the standard input
       stream is read.

       It is the user’s responsibility to provide appropriate  definitions  of
       the  [1mPS[22m,  [1mPE[22m,  and  one  or both of the [1mPF [22mand [1mPY [22mmacros.  When a macro
       package does not supply these, obtain simple definitions with the [4mgroff[0m
       option [1m-mpic[22m; these will center each picture.

       GNU [4mpic[24m supports [1mPY [22mas a synonym of [1mPF [22mto work around a name space col‐
       lision with the [4mmm[24m macro package, which defines [1mPF  [22mas  a  page  footer
       management macro.  Use [1mPF [22mpreferentially unless a similar problem faces
       your document.

              in milliinches; a missing argument restores  the  previous  line
              thickness;  the  default  line  thickness is 8 milliinches.  The
              line thickness thus specified takes effect only when a non‐nega‐
              tive  line  thickness  has  not  been  specified  by  use of the

              dent.

[1mUsage[0m
       This section primarily discusses the differences between  GNU  [4mpic[24m  and
       the  Eighth  Edition Research Unix version of AT&T [4mpic[24m (1985).  Many of
       these differences also apply to later versions of AT&T [4mpic[24m.

   [1mTeX mode[0m
       TeX‐compatible output is produced when the [1m-t [22moption is specified.  You
       must use a TeX driver that supports [4mtpic[24m version 2 specials.  ([4mtpic[24m was
       a fork of AT&T [4mpic[24m by Tim Morgan of the  University  of  California  at
       Irvine that diverged from its source around 1984.  It is best known to‐
       day for lending its name to a group of [1m\special  [22mcommands  it  produced
       for TeX.)

       Lines  beginning  with [1m\ [22mare passed through transparently; a [1m% [22mis added
       to the end of the line to avoid unwanted spaces.  You  can  safely  use
       this  feature  to change fonts or the value of [1m\baselineskip[22m.  Anything
       else may well produce undesirable results; use at your  own  risk.   By
       default,  lines  beginning with a dot are not treated specially—but see
       the [1m-c [22moption.

       In TeX mode, [4mpic[24m will define a vbox called  [1m\graph  [22mfor  each  picture.
       Use GNU [4mpic[24m’s [1mfigname [22mcommand to change the name of the vbox.  You must
       print that vbox yourself using the command
              \centerline{\box\graph}
       for instance.  Since the vbox has a height of zero (it is defined  with
       [1m\vtop[22m) this will produce slightly more vertical space above the picture
       than below it;
              \centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}
       would avoid this.  To give the vbox a positive height and  a  depth  of
       zero  (as used by LaTeX’s [4mgraphics.sty[24m, for example) define the follow‐
       ing macro in your document.
              \def\gpicbox#1{%
                \vbox{\unvbox\csname #1\endcsname\kern 0pt}}
       You can then simply say [1m\gpicbox{graph} [22minstead of [1m\box\graph[22m.

   [1mCommands[0m
       Several commands new to GNU [4mpic[24m accept delimiters, shown in their  syn‐
       opses  as braces [1m{ }[22m.  Nesting of braces is supported.  Any other char‐
       acters (except a space, tab, or newline) may be used as alternative de‐
       limiters,  in which case the members of a given pair must be identical.
       Strings are recognized within delimiters of either kind; they may  con‐
       tain the delimiter character or unbalanced braces.

              Set [4mvariable[24m to [4mexpr1[24m.  While the value of [4mvariable[24m is less than
              or equal to [4mexpr2[24m, do [4mbody[24m and increment [4mvariable[24m by  [4mexpr3[24m;  if
              [1mby  [22mis not given, increment [4mvariable[24m by 1.  If [4mexpr3[24m is prefixed
              by [1m* [22mthen [4mvariable[24m will instead be  multiplied  by  [4mexpr3[24m.   The
              value  of  [4mexpr3[24m can be negative for the additive case; [4mvariable[0m
              is then tested whether it is greater than  or  equal  to  [4mexpr2[24m.
              For  the  multiplicative  case, [4mexpr3[24m must be greater than zero.
              If the constraints aren’t met, the loop isn’t executed.   [4mX[24m  can
              be any character not occurring in [4mbody[24m.

              Evaluate  [4mexpr[24m;  if it is non‐zero then do [4mif‐true[24m, otherwise do
              [4mif‐false[24m.  [4mX[24m can be any character not occurring in  [4mif‐true[24m.   [4mY[0m
              can be any character not occurring in [4mif‐false[24m.

              Concatenate  and  write  arguments  to the standard error stream
              followed by a newline.  Each [4marg[24m must be an expression, a  posi‐
              tion, or text.  This is useful for debugging.

       [1mcommand [4m[22marg[24m ...
              Concatenate  arguments  and pass them as a line to [4mtroff[24m or TeX.
              Each [4marg[24m must be an expression, a position,  or  text.   [1mcommand[0m
              allows  the  values of [4mpic[24m variables to be passed to the format‐
              ter.  For example,
                     .PS
                     x = 14
                     command ".ds string x is " x "."
                     .PE
                     \*[string]

              This construct does [4mbody[24m once for each  line  of  [4mfilename[24m;  the
              line  is split into blank‐delimited words, and occurrences of [1m$[4m[22mi[0m
              in [4mbody[24m, for [4mi[24m between 1 and 9, are replaced by the [4mi[24m‐th word of
              the  line.   If  [4mfilename[24m is not given, lines are taken from the
              current input up to [1m.PE[22m.  If an [1muntil [22mclause is specified, lines
              will  be read only until a line the first word of which is [4mword[24m;
              that line will then be discarded.  [4mX[24m can be  any  character  not
              occurring in [4mbody[24m.  For example,
                     .PS
                     copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until "END"
                     1 2

                     .PE
              and
                     .PS
                     circle at (1,2)
                     circle at (3,4)
                     circle at (5,6)
                     box
                     .PE
              are  equivalent.  The commands to be performed for each line can
              also be taken from a macro defined earlier by giving the name of
              the  macro  as the argument to [1mthru[22m.  The argument after [1mthru [22mis
              looked up as a macro name first; if not defined, its first char‐
              acter is interpreted as a delimiter.

              This is a text object which is constructed by using  [4mtext[24m  as  a
              format  string for sprintf with an argument of [4mexpr[24m.  If [4mtext[24m is
              omitted a format string of [1m"%g"  [22mis  used.   Attributes  can  be
              specified  in the same way as for a normal text object.  Be very
              careful that you specify an appropriate format string; [4mpic[24m  does
              only very limited checking of the string.  This is deprecated in
              favour of [1msprintf[22m.

       [4mvar[24m [1m:= [4m[22mexpr[0m
              This syntax resembles variable assignment with [1m= [22mexcept that [4mvar[0m
              must  already be defined, and [4mexpr[24m will be assigned to [4mvar[24m with‐
              out creating a variable local to the current  block.   (By  con‐
              trast,  [1m=  [22mdefines [4mvar[24m in the current block if it is not already
              defined there, and then changes the value in the  current  block
              only.)  For example,

       String comparison expressions must be parenthesised in some contexts to
       avoid ambiguity.

   [1mOther changes[0m
       A bare expression, [4mexpr[24m, is acceptable as an attribute; it  is  equiva‐
       lent to [4mdir[24m [4mexpr[24m, where [4mdir[24m is the current direction.  For example

              [1mline 2i[0m

       means  draw a line 2 inches long in the current direction.  The ‘i’ (or
       ‘I’) character is ignored; to use another  measurement  unit,  set  the
       [4mscale[24m variable to an appropriate value.

       The  maximum  width  and height of the picture are taken from the vari‐
       ables [1mmaxpswid [22mand [1mmaxpsht[22m.  Initially, these have values 8.5 and 11.

       Scientific notation is allowed for numbers.  For example

              [1mx = 5e-2[0m

       Text attributes can be compounded.  For example,

              [1m"foo" above ljust[0m

       is valid.

       There is no limit to the depth to which blocks can  be  examined.   For
       example,

              [A: [B: [C: box ]]] with .A.B.C.sw at 1,2
              circle at last [].A.B.C

       is acceptable.

       Arcs  now have compass points determined by the circle of which the arc
       is a part.

       Circles, ellipses, and arcs can be  dotted  or  dashed.   In  TeX  mode
       splines can be dotted or dashed also.

       Boxes can have rounded corners.  The [1mrad [22mattribute specifies the radius
       of the quarter‐circles at each corner.  If no [1mrad [22mor [1mdiam [22mattribute  is
       given, a radius of [1mboxrad [22mis used.  Initially, [1mboxrad [22mhas a value of 0.
       A box with rounded corners can be dotted or dashed.

       Boxes can have slanted sides.  This effectively changes the shape of  a
       box  from  a rectangle to an arbitrary parallelogram.  The [1mxslanted [22mand
       [1myslanted [22mattributes specify the x and y offset of the box’s upper right
       corner from its default position.

       The [1m.PS [22mline can have a second argument specifying a maximum height for
       the picture.  If the width of zero is specified the width will  be  ig‐
       nored  in  computing  the scaling factor for the picture.  GNU [4mpic[24m will
       always scale a picture by the same amount vertically as well  as  hori‐
       zontally.  This is different from DWB 2.0 [4mpic[24m which may scale a picture
       by a different amount vertically than horizontally if a height is spec‐
       ified.

       Each  text object has an invisible box associated with it.  The compass
       points of a text object are determined by this box.  The  implicit  mo‐
       tion  associated  with  the object is also determined by this box.  The
       dimensions of this box are taken from the width and height  attributes;
       if  the width attribute is not supplied then the width will be taken to
       be [1mtextwid[22m; if the height attribute is not  supplied  then  the  height
       will  be taken to be the number of text strings associated with the ob‐
       ject times [1mtextht[22m.  Initially, [1mtextwid [22mand [1mtextht [22mhave a value of 0.

       In (almost all) places where a quoted text string can be used,  an  ex‐
       pression of the form

              [1msprintf("[4m[22mformat[24m[1m", [4m[22marg[24m[1m, [22m...[1m)[0m

       can  also  be used; this will produce the arguments formatted according
       to [4mformat[24m, which should be a string as described in [4mprintf[24m(3) appropri‐
       ate for the number of arguments supplied.  Only the modifiers “[1m#[22m”, “[1m-[22m”,
       “[1m+[22m”, and “ ” [space]), a minimum field width,  an  optional  precision,
       and the conversion specifiers [1m%e[22m, [1m%E[22m, [1m%f[22m, [1m%g[22m, [1m%G[22m, and [1m%% [22mare supported.

       The  thickness  of  the lines used to draw objects is controlled by the
       [1mlinethick [22mvariable.  This gives the thickness of lines  in  points.   A
       negative  value  means  use  the default thickness: in TeX output mode,
       this means use a thickness of 8 milliinches; in TeX  output  mode  with
       the  [1m-c  [22moption,  this  means  use  the line thickness specified by [1m.ps[0m
       lines; in [4mtroff[24m output mode, this means use a thickness proportional to
       the pointsize.  A zero value means draw the thinnest possible line sup‐
       ported by the output device.  Initially, it has a value of  -1.   There
       is also a [1mthick[22m[[1mness[22m] attribute.  For example,

              [1mcircle thickness 1.5[0m

       would  draw  a circle using a line with a thickness of 1.5 points.  The
       thickness of lines is not affected by the value of the [1mscale  [22mvariable,
       nor by the width or height given in the [1m.PS [22mline.

       Boxes  (including boxes with rounded corners or slanted sides), circles
       and ellipses can be filled by giving them  an  attribute  of  [1mfill[22m[[1med[22m].
       This takes an optional argument of an expression with a value between 0
       and 1; 0 will fill it with white, 1 with black, values in between  with
       a  proportionally gray shade.  A value greater than 1 can also be used:
       this means fill with the shade of gray that is currently being used for
       text  and  lines.   Normally this will be black, but output devices may
       provide a mechanism for changing this.  Without an argument,  then  the
       value  of  the  variable  [1mfillval  [22mwill be used.  Initially, this has a
       value of 0.5.  The invisible attribute does not affect the  filling  of
       objects.   Any text associated with a filled object will be added after
       the object has been filled, so that the text will not  be  obscured  by
       the filling.

       Additional  modifiers are available to draw colored objects: [1moutline[22m[[1md[22m]
       sets the color of the outline, [1mshaded [22mthe fill color, and  [1mcolo[22m[[1mu[22m][1mr[22m[[1med[22m]
       sets  both.   All  expect  a  subsequent string argument specifying the
       color.
              circle shaded "green" outline "black"
       Color is not yet supported  in  TeX  mode.   Device  macro  files  like
       [4mps.tmac[24m  declare  color  names; you can define additional ones with the
       [1mdefcolor [22mrequest (see [4mgroff[24m(7)).

       To change the name of the vbox in TeX  mode,  set  the  pseudo‐variable
       [1mfigname  [22m(which  is  actually a specially parsed command) within a pic‐
       ture.  Example:

              [1m.PS[0m
              [1mfigname = foobar;[0m
              [1m...[0m
              [1m.PE[0m

       The picture is then available in the box [1m\foobar[22m.

       [4mpic[24m assumes that at the beginning of a  picture  both  glyph  and  fill
       color are set to the default value.

       Arrow  heads will be drawn as solid triangles if the variable [1marrowhead[0m
       is non‐zero and either TeX mode is enabled or the  [1m-n  [22moption  has  not
       been  given.  Initially, [1marrowhead [22mhas a value of 1.  Solid arrow heads
       are always filled with the current outline color.

       The [4mtroff[24m output of [4mpic[24m is device‐independent.  The [1m-T [22moption is there‐
       fore  redundant.   All  numbers  are taken to be in inches; numbers are
       never interpreted to be in [4mtroff[24m machine units.

       Objects can have an [1maligned [22mattribute.  This  will  only  work  if  the
       postprocessor  is  [4mgrops[24m(1)  or [4mgropdf[24m(1).  Any text associated with an
       object having the [1maligned [22mattribute will be rotated about the center of
       the  object so that it is aligned in the direction from the start point
       to the end point of the object.  This attribute will have no effect  on
       objects whose start and end points are coincident.

       In  places  where [4mn[24m[1mth [22mis allowed, [1m'[4m[22mexpr[24m[1m'th [22mis also allowed.  “[1m'th[22m“ is a
       single token: no space is allowed between the apostrophe and the  “[1mth[22m”.
       For example,

              for i = 1 to 4 do {
                 line from 'i'th box.nw to 'i+1'th box.se
              }

[1mConversion[0m
       To  obtain a stand‐alone picture from a [4mpic[24m file, enclose your [4mpic[24m code
       with [1m.PS [22mand [1m.PE [22mrequests; [4mroff[24m configuration commands may be added  at
       the beginning of the file, but no [4mroff[24m text.

       It  is  necessary  to feed this file into [4mgroff[24m without adding any page
       information, so you must check which [1m.PS [22mand [1m.PE [22mrequests are  actually
       called.  For example, the [4mmm[24m macro package adds a page number, which is
       very annoying.  At the moment, calling standard [4mgroff[24m without any macro
       package  works.  Alternatively, you can define your own requests, e.g.,
       to do nothing:

              .de PS
              ..
              .de PE
              ..

       [4mgroff[24m itself does not provide direct  conversion  into  other  graphics
       file  formats.  But there are lots of possibilities if you first trans‐
       form your picture into PostScript® format using the [4mgroff[24m option  [1m-Tps[22m.
       Since  this [4mps[24m‐file lacks BoundingBox information it is not very useful
       by itself, but it may be fed into other  conversion  programs,  usually
       named  [1mps2[4m[22mother[24m or [1mpsto[4m[22mother[24m or the like.  Moreover, the PostScript in‐
       terpreter Ghostscript ([4mgs[24m(1)) has built‐in graphics conversion  devices
       that are called with the option

              [1mgs -sDEVICE=[4m[22m<devname>[0m

       Call

              [1mgs --help[0m

       for a list of the available devices.

       An  alternative  may be to use the [1m-Tpdf [22moption to convert your picture
       directly into [1mPDF [22mformat.  The MediaBox of the  file  produced  can  be
       controlled by passing a [1m-P-p [22mpapersize to [4mgroff[24m.

       As the Encapsulated PostScript File Format [1mEPS [22mis getting more and more
       important, and the conversion wasn’t regarded trivial in the  past  you
       might  be  interested  to  know  that  there is a conversion tool named
       [4mps2eps[24m which does the right job.  It  is  much  better  than  the  tool
       [4mps2epsi[24m packaged with [4mgs[24m.

       For  bitmapped  graphic  formats, you should use [4mpstopnm[24m; the resulting
       (intermediate) [4mpnm[24m(5) file can  be  then  converted  to  virtually  any
       graphics format using the tools of the [1mnetpbm [22mpackage.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mpic2graph[24m reads a [4mpic[24m(1) program from the standard input and writes  an
       image  file,  by  default in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, to
       the standard output.  It furthermore translates [4meqn[24m(1)  constructs,  so
       it can be used for generating images of mathematical formulae.

       The  input  PIC  code  should  [4mnot[24m  be wrapped with the [1m.PS [22mand [1m.PE[22m/[1m.PF[0m
       macros that normally guard it within [4mgroff[24m(1) documents.

       Arguments not recognized by [4mpic2graph[24m are passed to the ImageMagick  or
       GraphicsMagick  program  [4mconvert[24m(1).  By specifying these, you can give
       your image a border, set the image’s pixel density,  or  perform  other
       useful transformations.

       The  output image is clipped using [4mconvert[24m’s [1m-trim [22moption to the small‐
       est possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.

              [4mdelimiters[24m should be a two‐character string, but an empty string

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mpreconv[24m reads each [4mfile[24m, converts its  encoded  characters  to  a  form
       [4mtroff[24m(1)  can  interpret,  and  sends the result to the standard output
       stream.  Currently, this means that code points in the range 0–127  (in
       US‐ASCII, ISO 8859, or Unicode) remain as‐is and the remainder are con‐
       verted to the [4mgroff[24m special character form “[1m\[u[4m[22mXXXX[24m[1m][22m”, where [4mXXXX[24m is  a
       hexadecimal  number  of  four  to six digits corresponding to a Unicode
       code point.  By default, [4mpreconv[24m also inserts a [4mroff[24m [1m.lf [22mrequest at the
       beginning  of  each  [4mfile[24m, identifying it for the benefit of later pro‐
       cessing (including diagnostic messages); the [1m-r [22moption suppresses  this
       behavior.

       In  typical  usage scenarios, [4mpreconv[24m need not be run directly; instead
       it should be invoked with the [1m-k [22mor [1m-K [22moptions of [4mgroff[24m.   If  no  [4mfile[0m
       operands are given on the command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, the standard
       input stream is read.

       [4mpreconv[24m tries to find the input encoding with the following  algorithm,
       stopping at the first success.

       1.  If the input encoding has been explicitly specified with option [1m-e[22m,
           use it.

       2.  If the input starts with a Unicode Byte Order Mark,  determine  the
           encoding as UTF‐8, UTF‐16, or UTF‐32 accordingly.

       3.  If  the  input stream is seekable, check the first and second input
           lines for a recognized GNU Emacs  file‐local  variable  identifying
           the  character  encoding,  here referred to as the “coding tag” for
           brevity.  If found, use it.

       4.  If the input stream is seekable, and if  the  [4muchardet[24m  library  is
           available on the system, use it to try to infer the encoding of the
           file.

       5.  If the [1m-D [22moption specifies an encoding, use it.

       6.  Use the encoding specified by the current locale ([4mLC_CTYPE[24m), unless
           the  locale is “C”, “POSIX”, or empty, in which case assume Latin‐1
           (ISO 8859‐1).

       The coding tag and [4muchardet[24m methods in the above procedure rely upon  a
       seekable  input  stream;  when [4mpreconv[24m reads from a pipe, the stream is
       not seekable, and these detection methods are  skipped.   If  character
       encoding  detection  of your input files is unreliable, arrange for one
       of the other methods to succeed by using [4mpreconv[24m’s [1m-D [22mor [1m-e [22moptions, or
       by  configuring  your  locale  appropriately.   [4mgroff[24m  also  supports a
       [4mGROFF_ENCODING[24m environment variable, which can be overridden by its  [1m-K[0m
       option.   Valid  values for (or parameters to) all of these are enumer‐
       ated in the lists of recognized coding tags in the next subsection, and
       are further influenced by [4miconv[24m library support.

   [1mCoding tags[0m
       Text  editors  that  support more than a single character encoding need
       tags within the input files to mark the file’s encoding.  While  it  is
       possible  to guess the right input encoding with the help of heuristics
       that are reliable for a preponderance of natural language  texts,  they
       are  not  absolutely  reliable.  Heuristics can fail on inputs that are
       too short or don’t represent a natural language.

       Consequently, [4mpreconv[24m  supports  the  coding  tag  convention  used  by
       GNU Emacs (with some restrictions).  This notation appears in specially
       marked regions of an input file designated for “file‐local variables”.

       [4mpreconv[24m interprets the following syntax if it occurs in a [4mroff[24m  comment
       in the first or second line of the input file.  Both “\"” and “\#” com‐
       ment forms are recognized, but the control (or no‐break control)  char‐
       acter  must be the default and must begin the line.  Similarly, the es‐
       cape character must be the default.
              [1m-*- [22m[...[1m;[22m] [1mcoding: [4m[22mencoding[24m[[1m; [22m...] [1m-*-[0m

       The only variable [4mpreconv[24m interprets is “coding”, which  can  take  the
       values listed below.

       The following list comprises all MIME “charset” parameter values recog‐
       nized, case‐insensitively, by [4mpreconv[24m.
              big5, cp1047, euc-jp, euc-kr,  gb2312,  iso-8859-1,  iso-8859-2,
              iso-8859-5,  iso-8859-7,  iso-8859-9,  iso-8859-13, iso-8859-15,
              koi8-r, us-ascii, utf-8, utf-16, utf-16be, utf-16le

       In addition, the following list of other  coding  tags  is  recognized,
       each of which is mapped to an appropriate value from the list above.
              ascii,  chinese-big5,  chinese-euc,  chinese-iso-8bit,  cn-big5,
              cn-gb,     cn-gb-2312,     cp878,     csascii,      csisolatin1,

              euc-japan-1990,   euc-korea,   greek-iso-8bit,   iso-10646/utf8,
              iso-10646/utf-8,    iso-latin-1,    iso-latin-2,    iso-latin-5,
              iso-latin-7, iso-latin-9, japanese-euc, japanese-iso-8bit, jis8,
              koi8,  korean-euc,  korean-iso-8bit,  latin-0,  latin1, latin-1,
              latin-2, latin-5,  latin-7,  latin-9,  mule-utf-8,  mule-utf-16,
              mule-utf-16be,   mule-utf-16-be,   mule-utf-16be-with-signature,
              mule-utf-16le,   mule-utf-16-le,   mule-utf-16le-with-signature,
              utf8,            utf-16-be,            utf-16-be-with-signature,
              utf-16be-with-signature,  utf-16-le,   utf-16-le-with-signature,
              utf-16le-with-signature

       Trailing “-dos”, “-unix”, and “-mac” suffixes on coding tags (which in‐
       dicate the end‐of‐line convention used in the file) are disregarded for
       the purpose of comparison with the above tags.

   [4m[1miconv[24m support[0m
       While [4mpreconv[24m recognizes all of the coding tags listed above, it is ca‐
       pable on its own of interpreting only three  encodings:  Latin‐1,  code
       page  1047,  and UTF‐8.  If [4miconv[24m support is configured at compile time
       and available at run time, all others are passed to [4miconv[24m library func‐
       tions,  which may recognize many additional encoding strings.  The com‐
       mand “[1mpreconv -v[22m” discloses whether [4miconv[24m support is configured.

       The use of [4miconv[24m means that characters in the input that encode invalid
       code  points for that encoding may be dropped from the output stream or
       mapped to the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).  Compare the fol‐
       lowing  examples using the input “café” (note the “e” with an acute ac‐
       cent), which due to its short length challenges inference of the encod‐
       ing used.
              printf 'caf\351\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 preconv
              printf 'caf\351\n' | preconv -e us-ascii
              printf 'caf\351\n' | preconv -e latin-1
       The  fate  of  the  accented  “e”  differs in each case.  In the first,
       [4muchardet[24m fails to detect an encoding (though the library on your system
       may  behave differently) and [4mpreconv[24m falls back to the locale settings,
       where octal 351 starts an incomplete UTF‐8 sequence and results in  the
       Unicode  replacement  character.   In  the  second,  it is not a repre‐
       sentable character in the declared input encoding of  US‐ASCII  and  is
       discarded by [4miconv[24m.  In the last, it is correctly detected and mapped.

   [1mLimitations[0m
       [4mpreconv[24m  cannot perform any transformation on input that it cannot see.
       Examples include files that are interpolated by preprocessors that  run
       subsequently,  including  [4msoelim[24m(1);  files  included  by  [4mtroff[24m itself
       through “[1mso[22m” and similar requests; and  string  definitions  passed  to
       [4mtroff[24m through its [1m-d [22mcommand‐line option.

       [4mpreconv[24m  assumes  that  its  input uses the default escape character, a
       backslash [1m\[22m, and writes special character escape sequences accordingly.

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  implementation of [4mrefer[24m is part of the [4mgroff[24m(1) document for‐
       matting system.  [4mrefer[24m is a [4mtroff[24m(1) preprocessor that prepares bibilo‐
       graphic  citations  by looking up keywords specified in a [4mroff[24m(7) input
       document, obviating the need to type such annotations,  and  permitting
       the  citation style in formatted output to be altered independently and
       systematically.  It copies the contents of each [4mfile[24m  to  the  standard
       output stream, except that it interprets lines between [1m.[ [22mand [1m.] [22mas ci‐
       tations to be translated into [4mgroff[24m input, and lines  between  [1m.R1  [22mand
       [1m.R2  [22mas instructions regarding how citations are to be processed.  Nor‐
       mally, [4mrefer[24m is not executed directly by the user, but invoked by spec‐
       ifying the [1m-R [22moption to [4mgroff[24m(1).  If no [4mfile[24m operands are given on the
       command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, the standard input stream is read.

       Each citation specifies a reference.  The citation can specify a refer‐
       ence  that  is contained in a bibliographic database by giving a set of
       keywords that only that reference contains.  Alternatively it can spec‐
       ify a reference by supplying a database record in the citation.  A com‐
       bination of these alternatives is also possible.

       For each citation, [4mrefer[24m can produce a mark in  the  text.   This  mark
       consists  of  some  label which can be separated from the text and from
       other labels in various ways.   For  each  reference  it  also  outputs
       [4mgroff[24m(7)  language commands that can be used by a macro package to pro‐
       duce a formatted reference for each citation.  The output of [4mrefer[24m must
       therefore  be processed using a suitable macro package, such as [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m,
       [4mmom[24m, or [4mms[24m.  The commands to format a citation’s reference can be  out‐
       put  immediately  after  the citation, or the references may be accumu‐
       lated, and the commands output at some later point.  If the  references
       are  accumulated,  then  multiple  citations of the same reference will
       produce a single formatted reference.

       The interpretation of lines between [1m.R1 [22mand [1m.R2 [22mas  prepreocessor  com‐
       mands  is a feature of GNU [4mrefer[24m.  Documents making use of this feature
       can still be processed by AT&T [4mrefer[24m just by adding the lines
              .de R1
              .ig R2
              ..
       to the beginning of the document.  This will cause [4mtroff[24m(1)  to  ignore
       everything  between  [1m.R1 [22mand [1m.R2[22m.  The effect of some commands can also
       be achieved by options.  These options are supported mainly for compat‐
       ibility  with  AT&T  [4mrefer[24m.   It is usually more convenient to use com‐
       mands.

       [4mrefer[24m generates [1m.lf [22mrequests so that file names  and  line  numbers  in
       messages  produced  by commands that read [4mrefer[24m output will be correct;
       it also interprets lines beginning with [1m.lf [22mso that file names and line
       numbers in the messages and [1m.lf [22mlines that it produces will be accurate
       even if the input has been preprocessed by a command such as [4msoelim[24m(1).

   [1mBibliographic databases[0m
       The bibliographic database is a text file consisting of  records  sepa‐
       rated by one or more blank lines.  Within each record fields start with
       a [1m% [22mat the beginning of a line.  Each field has a  one  character  name
       that immediately follows the [1m%[22m.  It is best to use only upper and lower
       case letters for the names of fields.  The name of the field should  be
       followed  by  exactly one space, and then by the contents of the field.
       Empty fields are ignored.  The conventional meaning of each field is as
       follows:

       [1m%A     [22mThe  name  of  an author.  If the name contains a suffix such as
              “Jr.”, it should be separated from the last  name  by  a  comma.
              There can be multiple occurrences of the [1m%A [22mfield.  The order is
              significant.  It is a good idea always to supply an [1m%A [22mfield  or
              a [1m%Q [22mfield.

       [1m%B     [22mFor an article that is part of a book, the title of the book.

       [1m%C     [22mThe place (city) of publication.

       [1m%D     [22mThe  date of publication.  The year should be specified in full.
              If the month is specified, the name rather than  the  number  of
              the  month  should be used, but only the first three letters are
              required.  It is a good idea always to supply a [1m%D [22mfield; if the
              date  is  unknown,  a  value  such as [1min press [22mor [1munknown [22mcan be
              used.

       [1m%E     [22mFor an article that is part of a book, the name of an editor  of
              the  book.  Where the work has editors and no authors, the names
              of the editors should be given as [1m%A [22mfields  and  “[1m,  (ed.)[22m”  or
              “[1m, (eds.)[22m” should be appended to the last author.

       [1m%G     [22mU.S. government ordering number.

       [1m%I     [22mThe publisher (issuer).

       [1m%J     [22mFor an article in a journal, the name of the journal.

       [1m%K     [22mKeywords to be used for searching.

       [1m%L     [22mLabel.

       [1m%N     [22mJournal issue number.

       [1m%O     [22mOther  information.   This  is usually printed at the end of the
              reference.

       [1m%P     [22mPage number.  A range of pages can be specified as [4mm[24m[1m-[4m[22mn[24m.

       [1m%Q     [22mThe name of the author, if the author is  not  a  person.   This
              will  only be used if there are no [1m%A [22mfields.  There can only be
              one [1m%Q [22mfield.

       [1m%R     [22mTechnical report number.

       [1m%S     [22mSeries name.

       [1m%T     [22mTitle.  For an article in a book or journal, this should be  the
              title of the article.

       [1m%V     [22mVolume number of the journal or book.

       [1m%X     [22mAnnotation.

       For  all  fields except [1m%A [22mand [1m%E[22m, if there is more than one occurrence
       of a particular field in a record, only the last  such  field  will  be
       used.

       If  accent strings are used, they should follow the character to be ac‐
       cented.  This means that an [4mms[24m document must call the [1m.AM [22mmacro when it
       initializes.   Accent  strings  should  not be quoted: use one [1m\ [22mrather
       than two.  Accent strings are an obsolescent feature of the [4mme[24m  and  [4mms[0m
       macro packages; modern documents should use [4mgroff[24m special character es‐
       cape sequences instead; see [4mgroff_char[24m(7).

   [1mCitations[0m
       Citations have a characteristic format.
              [1m.[[4m[22mopening‐text[0m
              [4mflags[24m [4mkeywords[0m
              [4mfields[0m
              [1m.][4m[22mclosing‐text[0m

       The [4mopening‐text[24m, [4mclosing‐text[24m,  and  [4mflags[24m  components  are  optional.
       Only one of the [4mkeywords[24m and [4mfields[24m components need be specified.

       The [4mkeywords[24m component says to search the bibliographic databases for a
       reference that contains all the words in [4mkeywords[24m.  It is an  error  if
       more than one reference is found.

       The [4mfields[24m components specifies additional fields to replace or supple‐
       ment those specified in the reference.  When references are being accu‐
       mulated and the [4mkeywords[24m component is non‐empty, then additional fields
       should be specified only on the first occasion that a particular refer‐
       ence is cited, and will apply to all citations of that reference.

       The [4mopening‐text[24m and [4mclosing‐text[24m components specify strings to be used
       to bracket the label instead of those in the [1mbracket-label [22mcommand.  If
       either  of  these components is non‐empty, the strings specified in the
       [1mbracket-label [22mcommand will not be used; this behavior  can  be  altered
       using  the  [1m[ [22mand [1m] [22mflags.  Leading and trailing spaces are significant
       for these components.

       The [4mflags[24m component is a list of non‐alphanumeric  characters  each  of
       which  modifies  the treatment of this particular citation.  AT&T [4mrefer[0m
       will treat these flags as part of the keywords and so will ignore  them
       since  they  are  non‐alphanumeric.   The following flags are currently
       recognized.

       [1m#      [22mUse the label specified by the [1mshort-label [22mcommand,  instead  of
              that specified by the [1mlabel [22mcommand.  If no short label has been
              specified, the normal label will be used.  Typically  the  short
              label  is  used with author‐date labels and consists of only the
              date and possibly a disambiguating letter; the “[1m#[22m”  is  supposed
              to be suggestive of a numeric type of label.

       [1m[      [22mPrecede  [4mopening‐text[24m  with  the  first  string specified in the
              [1mbracket-label [22mcommand.

       [1m]      [22mFollow [4mclosing‐text[24m with the  second  string  specified  in  the
              [1mbracket-label [22mcommand.

       An  advantage  of  using  the  [1m[  [22mand [1m] [22mflags rather than including the
       brackets in [4mopening‐text[24m and [4mclosing‐text[24m is that you  can  change  the
       style   of   bracket   used  in  the  document  just  by  changing  the
       [1mbracket-label [22mcommand.  Another is that sorting and  merging  of  cita‐
       tions will not necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.

       If  a label is to be inserted into the text, it will be attached to the
       line preceding the [1m.[ [22mline.  If there is no such line,  then  an  extra
       line will be inserted before the [1m.[ [22mline and a warning will be given.

       There  is  no special notation for making a citation to multiple refer‐
       ences.  Just use a sequence  of  citations,  one  for  each  reference.
       Don’t put anything between the citations.  The labels for all the cita‐
       tions will be attached to the line preceding the first  citation.   The
       labels may also be sorted or merged.  See the description of the [1m<> [22mla‐
       bel    expression,    and    of    the     [1msort-adjacent-labels     [22mand
       [1mabbreviate-label-ranges  [22mcommands.   A  label will not be merged if its
       citation has a non‐empty [4mopening‐text[24m or  [4mclosing‐text[24m.   However,  the
       labels for a citation using the [1m] [22mflag and without any [4mclosing‐text[24m im‐
       mediately followed by a citation using the [1m[ [22mflag and without any [4mopen‐[0m
       [4ming‐text[24m  may  be  sorted  and  merged even though the first citation’s
       [4mopening‐text[24m or the second citation’s [4mclosing‐text[24m is  non‐empty.   (If
       you wish to prevent this, use the dummy character escape sequence [1m\& [22mas
       the first citation’s [4mclosing‐text[24m.)

   [1mCommands[0m
       Commands are contained between lines starting with [1m.R1 [22mand [1m.R2[22m.  Recog‐
       nition  of  these  lines can be prevented by the [1m-R [22moption.  When a [1m.R1[0m
       line is recognized any accumulated references are flushed out.  Neither
       [1m.R1 [22mnor [1m.R2 [22mlines, nor anything between them, is output.

       Commands  are  separated  by newlines or semicolons.  A number sign ([1m#[22m)
       introduces a comment that extends to the end of the line, but does  not
       conceal  the newline.  Each command is broken up into words.  Words are
       separated by spaces or tabs.  A word that begins with a (neutral)  dou‐
       ble  quote ([1m"[22m) extends to the next double quote that is not followed by
       another double quote.  If there is no such double quote, the  word  ex‐
       tends  to the end of the line.  Pairs of double quotes in a word begin‐
       ning with a double quote collapse to one double quote.  Neither a  num‐
       ber  sign  nor  a semicolon is recognized inside double quotes.  A line
       can be continued by ending it with a backslash “[1m\[22m”; this  works  every‐
       where except after a number sign.

       Each command [4mname[24m that is marked with * has an associated negative com‐
       mand [1mno-[4m[22mname[24m that undoes the effect of [4mname[24m.  For example, the  [1mno-sort[0m
       command  specifies  that references should not be sorted.  The negative
       commands take no arguments.

       In the following description each argument must be a single word; [4mfield[0m
       is  used for a single upper or lower case letter naming a field; [4mfields[0m
       is used for a sequence of such letters; [4mm[24m and [4mn[24m are used for a non‐neg‐
       ative numbers; [4mstring[24m is used for an arbitrary string; [4mfile[24m is used for
       the name of a file.

       [1mabbreviate[22m* [4mfields[24m [4mstring1[24m [4mstring2[24m [4mstring3[24m [4mstring4[0m
              Abbreviate the first names of [4mfields[24m.  An initial letter will be
              separated  from another initial letter by [4mstring1[24m, from the last
              name by [4mstring2[24m, and from anything else (such as “von” or  “de”)
              by  [4mstring3[24m.  These default to a period followed by a space.  In
              a hyphenated first name, the initial of the first  part  of  the
              name will be separated from the hyphen by [4mstring4[24m; this defaults
              to a period.  No attempt is made to handle any ambiguities  that
              might  result  from  abbreviation.  Names are abbreviated before
              sorting and before label construction.

       [1mabbreviate-label-ranges[22m* [4mstring[0m
              Three or more adjacent labels that refer to  consecutive  refer‐
              ences will be abbreviated to a label consisting of the first la‐
              bel, followed by [4mstring[24m, followed by the last  label.   This  is
              mainly useful with numeric labels.  If [4mstring[24m is omitted, it de‐
              faults to “[1m-[22m”.

       [1maccumulate[22m*
              Accumulate references instead of writing out each  reference  as
              it  is  encountered.  Accumulated references will be written out
              whenever a reference of the form
                     [1m.[[0m
                     [1m$LIST$[0m
                     [1m.][0m
              is encountered, after all input files have been  processed,  and
              whenever a [1m.R1 [22mline is recognized.

       [1mannotate[22m* [4mfield[24m [4mstring[0m
              [4mfield[24m  is an annotation; print it at the end of the reference as
              a paragraph preceded by the line

                     [1m.[4m[22mstring[0m

              If [4mstring[24m is omitted, it will default to [1mAP[22m; if  [4mfield[24m  is  also
              omitted  it will default to [1mX[22m.  Only one field can be an annota‐
              tion.

       [1marticles [4m[22mstring[24m ...
              Each [4mstring[24m is a definite or indefinite article, and  should  be
              ignored  at  the beginning of [1mT [22mfields when sorting.  Initially,
              “a”, “an”, and “the” are recognized as articles.

       [1mbibliography [4m[22mfile[24m ...
              Write out all the references  contained  in  each  bibliographic
              database  [4mfile[24m.   This  command  should  come last in an [1m.R1[22m/[1m.R2[0m
              block.

       [1mbracket-label [4m[22mstring1[24m [4mstring2[24m [4mstring3[0m
              In the text, bracket each label with [4mstring1[24m  and  [4mstring2[24m.   An
              occurrence  of  [4mstring2[24m  immediately followed by [4mstring1[24m will be
              turned into [4mstring3[24m.  The default behavior is as follows.
                     [1mbracket-label \*([. \*(.] ", "[0m

       [1mcapitalize [4m[22mfields[0m
              Convert [4mfields[24m to caps and small caps.

       [1mcompatible[22m*
              Recognize [1m.R1 [22mand [1m.R2 [22meven when followed by  a  character  other
              than space or newline.

       [1mdatabase [4m[22mfile[24m ...
              Search  each  bibliographic database [4mfile[24m.  For each [4mfile[24m, if an
              index file[4m.i[24m created by  [4mindxbib[24m(1)  exists,  then  it  will  be
              searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.

       [1mdate-as-label[22m* [4mstring[0m
              [4mstring[24m  is a label expression that specifies a string with which
              to replace the [1mD [22mfield after constructing the label.   See  sub‐
              section “Label expressions” below for a description of label ex‐
              pressions.  This command is useful if you do not  want  explicit
              labels  in  the  reference  list, but instead want to handle any
              necessary disambiguation by qualifying the  date  in  some  way.
              The  label  used in the text would typically be some combination
              of the author and date.  In most cases you should also  use  the
              [1mno-label-in-reference [22mcommand.  For example,
                     [1mdate-as-label D.+yD.y%a*D.-y[0m
              would  attach  a disambiguating letter to the year part of the [1mD[0m
              field in the reference.

       [1mdefault-database[22m*
              The default database should be searched.  This  is  the  default
              behavior,  so  the negative version of this command is more use‐
              ful.  [4mrefer[24m determines whether the default  database  should  be
              searched  on  the  first  occasion that it needs to do a search.
              Thus a [1mno-default-database [22mcommand must be given before then, in
              order to be effective.

       [1mdiscard[22m* [4mfields[0m
              When  the  reference  is  read,  [4mfields[24m  should be discarded; no
              string definitions for [4mfields[24m will be output.  Initially, [4mfields[0m
              are [1mXYZ[22m.

       [1met-al[22m* [4mstring[24m [4mm[24m [4mn[0m
              Control  use of [1met al. [22min the evaluation of [1m@ [22mexpressions in la‐
              bel expressions.  If the number of authors needed  to  make  the
              author sequence unambiguous is [4mu[24m and the total number of authors
              is [4mt[24m then the last [4mt[24m-[4mu[24m authors will be replaced by  [4mstring[24m  pro‐
              vided that [4mt[24m-[4mu[24m is not less than [4mm[24m and [4mt[24m is not less than [4mn[24m.  The
              default behavior is as follows.
                     [1met-al " et al" 2 3[0m
              Note the absence of a dot from  the  end  of  the  abbreviation,
              which is arguably not correct.  ([4mEt[24m [4mal[24m[.]  is short for [4met[24m [4malli[24m,
              as [4metc.[24m is short for [4met[24m [4mcetera[24m.)

       [1minclude [4m[22mfile[0m
              Include [4mfile[24m and interpret the contents as commands.

       [1mjoin-authors [4m[22mstring1[24m [4mstring2[24m [4mstring3[0m
              Join multiple authors together with [4mstring[24ms.  When there are ex‐
              actly two authors, they will be joined with [4mstring1[24m.  When there
              are more than two authors, all but the last two will  be  joined
              with  [4mstring2[24m,  and  the  last  two  authors will be joined with
              [4mstring3[24m.  If [4mstring3[24m is omitted, it will default to [4mstring1[24m;  if
              [4mstring2[24m  is  also  omitted it will also default to [4mstring1[24m.  For
              example,
                     join-authors " and " ", " ", and "
              will restore the default method for joining authors.

       [1mlabel-in-reference[22m*
              When outputting the reference, define the string [1m[F  [22mto  be  the
              reference’s  label.   This is the default behavior, so the nega‐
              tive version of this command is more useful.

       [1mlabel-in-text[22m*
              For each reference output a label in the text.  The  label  will
              be  separated  from  the  surrounding  text  as described in the
              [1mbracket-label [22mcommand.  This is the  default  behavior,  so  the
              negative version of this command is more useful.

       [1mlabel [4m[22mstring[0m
              [4mstring[24m is a label expression describing how to label each refer‐
              ence.

       [1mseparate-label-second-parts [4m[22mstring[0m
              When merging two‐part labels, separate the second  part  of  the
              second label from the first label with [4mstring[24m.  See the descrip‐
              tion of the [1m<> [22mlabel expression.

       [1mmove-punctuation[22m*
              In the text, move any punctuation at the end of  line  past  the
              label.   It  is  usually a good idea to give this command unless
              you are using superscripted numbers as labels.

       [1mreverse[22m* [4mstring[0m
              Reverse the fields whose names are in [4mstring[24m.  Each  field  name
              can  be  followed  by  a  number which says how many such fields
              should be reversed.  If no number is given for a field, all such
              fields will be reversed.

       [1msearch-ignore[22m* [4mfields[0m
              While searching for keys in databases for which no index exists,
              ignore the contents of [4mfields[24m.  Initially, fields  [1mXYZ  [22mare  ig‐
              nored.

       [1msearch-truncate[22m* [4mn[0m
              Only require the first [4mn[24m characters of keys to be given.  In ef‐
              fect when searching for a given key words in  the  database  are
              truncated  to  the maximum of [4mn[24m and the length of the key.  Ini‐
              tially, [4mn[24m is 6.

       [1mshort-label[22m* [4mstring[0m
              [4mstring[24m is a label expression that specifies an alternative (usu‐
              ally  shorter)  style of label.  This is used when the [1m# [22mflag is
              given in the citation.  When using author‐date style labels, the
              identity  of  the  author or authors is sometimes clear from the
              context, and so it may be desirable to omit the  author  or  au‐
              thors from the label.  The [1mshort-label [22mcommand will typically be
              used to specify a label containing just a date  and  possibly  a
              disambiguating letter.

       [1msort[22m* [4mstring[0m
              Sort  references according to [4mstring[24m.  References will automati‐
              cally be accumulated.  [4mstring[24m should be a list of  field  names,
              each  followed  by a number, indicating how many fields with the
              name should be used for sorting.  “[1m+[22m” can be  used  to  indicate
              that all the fields with the name should be used.  Also [1m. [22mcan be
              used to indicate the references should be sorted using the (ten‐
              tative)  label.  (Subsection “Label expressions” below describes
              the concept of a tentative label.)

       [1msort-adjacent-labels[22m*
              Sort labels that are adjacent in the text according to their po‐
              sition  in  the  reference list.  This command should usually be
              given if the [1mabbreviate-label-ranges [22mcommand has been given,  or
              if  the  label  expression  contains a [1m<> [22mexpression.  This will
              have no effect unless references are being accumulated.

   [1mLabel expressions[0m
       Label expressions can be evaluated both normally and tentatively.   The
       result  of  normal evaluation is used for output.  The result of tenta‐
       tive evaluation, called the [4mtentative[24m [4mlabel[24m, is used to gather the  in‐
       formation  that normal evaluation needs to disambiguate the label.  La‐
       bel expressions specified by the [1mdate-as-label [22mand [1mshort-label [22mcommands
       are not evaluated tentatively.  Normal and tentative evaluation are the
       same for all types of expression other than [1m@[22m, [1m*[22m,  and  [1m%  [22mexpressions.
       The description below applies to normal evaluation, except where other‐
       wise specified.

       [4mfield[0m
       [4mfield[24m [4mn[0m
              The [4mn[24m‐th part of [4mfield[24m.  If [4mn[24m is omitted, it defaults to 1.

       [1m'[4m[22mstring[24m[1m'[0m
              The characters in [4mstring[24m literally.

       [1m@      [22mAll the authors joined as specified by the [1mjoin-authors [22mcommand.
              The  whole  of each author’s name will be used.  However, if the
              references are sorted by author (that is, the sort specification
              starts  with  “[1mA+[22m”),  then  authors’ last names will be used in‐
              stead, provided that this does not introduce ambiguity, and also
              an initial subsequence of the authors may be used instead of all
              the authors, again provided that this does not introduce ambigu‐
              ity.   The use of only the last name for the [4mi[24m‐th author of some
              reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is  some  other
              reference, such that the first [4mi[24m-1 authors of the references are
              the same, the [4mi[24m‐th authors are not the same, but  the  [4mi[24m‐th  au‐
              thors  last names are the same.  A proper initial subsequence of
              the sequence of authors for some reference is considered  to  be
              ambiguous  if  there  is a reference with some other sequence of
              authors which also has that subsequence as a proper initial sub‐
              sequence.   When  an initial subsequence of authors is used, the
              remaining authors are replaced by the string  specified  by  the
              [1met-al [22mcommand; this command may also specify additional require‐
              ments that must be met before  an  initial  subsequence  can  be
              used.   [1m@ [22mtentatively evaluates to a canonical representation of
              the authors, such that authors that compare equally for  sorting
              purpose will have the same representation.

   [1mMacro interface[0m
       Each reference starts with a call to the macro [1m]-[22m.  The string [1m[F  [22mwill
       be   defined   to   be   the  label  for  this  reference,  unless  the
       [1mno-label-in-reference [22mcommand has been given.  There then follows a se‐
       ries  of  string definitions, one for each field: string [1m[[4m[22mX[24m corresponds
       to field [4mX[24m.  The register [1m[P [22mis set to 1 if  the  [1mP  [22mfield  contains  a
       range  of pages.  The [1m[T[22m, [1m[A [22mand [1m[O [22mregisters are set to 1 according as
       the [1mT[22m, [1mA [22mand [1mO [22mfields end with any of [1m.?! [22m(an  end‐of‐sentence  charac‐
       ter).   The [1m[E [22mregister will be set to 1 if the [1m[E [22mstring contains more
       than one name.  The reference is followed by a call to  the  [1m][  [22mmacro.
       The  first  argument to this macro gives a number representing the type
       of the reference.  If a reference contains a [1mJ [22mfield, it will be  clas‐
       sified  as  type  1,  otherwise  if  it  contains a [1mB [22mfield, it will be
       type 3, otherwise if it contains a [1mG [22mor [1mR [22mfield it will be type 4, oth‐
       erwise  if  it contains an [1mI [22mfield it will be type 2, otherwise it will
       be type 0.  The second argument is a symbolic name for the type: [1mother[22m,
       [1mjournal-article[22m, [1mbook[22m, [1marticle-in-book[22m, or [1mtech-report[22m.  Groups of ref‐
       erences that have been accumulated or are produced by the  [1mbibliography[0m
       command  are  preceded by a call to the [1m]< [22mmacro and followed by a call
       to the [1m]> [22mmacro.

       The foregoing shows us that [4mrefer[24m (a) produces a label “1”; (b)  brack‐
       ets  that label with interpolations of the “[1m[.[22m”  and “[1m.][22m”  strings; (c)
       calls a macro “[1m]-[22m”; (d) defines strings and  registers  containing  the
       label and bibliographic data for the reference; (e) calls a macro “[1m][[22m”;
       and (f) uses the [1mlf [22mrequest to restore the line numbers of the original
       input.  As discussed in subsection “Macro interface” above, it is up to
       the document or a macro package to employ and format  this  information
       usefully.  Let us see how we might turn [4mgroff_ms[24m(7) to this task.

[1mDescription[0m
       GNU [4msoelim[24m is a preprocessor for the [4mgroff[24m(7) document formatting  sys‐
       tem.   [4msoelim[24m works as a filter to eliminate source requests in [4mroff[24m(7)
       input files; that is, it replaces lines of the form “[1m.so [4m[22mincluded‐file[24m”
       within  each text [4minput‐file[24m with the contents of [4mincluded‐file[24m, recur‐
       sively.  By default, it writes [1mlf [22mrequests as well to record  the  name
       and line number of each [4minput‐file[24m and [4mincluded‐file[24m, so that any diag‐
       nostics produced by later processing can be accurately  traced  to  the
       original  input.   Options allow this information to be suppressed ([1m-r[22m)
       or supplied in TeX comments instead ([1m-t[22m).  In the absence of [4minput‐file[0m
       arguments,  [4msoelim[24m  reads the standard input stream.  Output is written
       to the standard output stream.

       If the name of a [4mmacro‐file[24m contains a backslash, use [1m\\ [22mor [1m\e [22mto embed
       it.  To embed a space, write “[1m\ [22m” (backslash followed by a space).  Any
       other escape sequence in [4mmacro‐file[24m, including “[1m\[rs][22m”, prevents [4msoelim[0m
       from replacing the source request.

       The dot must be at the beginning of a line and must be followed by “[1mso[22m”
       without intervening spaces or tabs for [4msoelim[24m to handle it.  This  con‐
       vention  allows  source  requests  to be “protected” from processing by
       [4msoelim[24m, for instance as part of macro definitions or “[1mif[22m” requests.

       There must also be at least one space between “[1mso[22m” and  its  [4mmacro‐file[0m
       argument.  The [1m-C [22moption overrides this requirement.

       The  foregoing  is the limit of [4msoelim[24m’s understanding of the [4mroff[24m lan‐
       guage; it does not, for example, replace the input line
              .if 1 .so otherfile
       with the contents of [4motherfile[24m.  With its [1m-r [22moption, therefore,  [4msoelim[0m
       can  be used to process text files in general, to flatten a tree of in‐
       put documents.

       [4msoelim[24m was designed to handle situations where the  target  of  a  [4mroff[0m
       source   request  requires  a  preprocessor  such  as  [4meqn[24m(1),  [4mpic[24m(1),
       [4mrefer[24m(1), or [4mtbl[24m(1).  The usual processing sequence of [4mgroff[24m(1)  is  as
       follows.

                 input        sourced
                 file          file

                                           file

       That  is, files sourced with “[1mso[22m” are normally read [4monly[24m by the format‐
       ter, [4mtroff[24m.  [4msoelim[24m is [4mnot[24m required for [4mtroff[24m to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be
       read  [4mbefore[24m  the  input file passes through the preprocessor.  [4msoelim[24m,
       normally invoked via [4mgroff[24m’s [1m-s [22moption, handles this.

[1mDescription[0m
       The GNU implementation of [4mtbl[24m is part of the [4mgroff[24m(1) document  format‐
       ting  system.   [4mtbl[24m is a [4mtroff[24m(1) preprocessor that translates descrip‐
       tions of tables embedded in [4mroff[24m(7) input files into the  language  un‐
       derstood by [4mtroff[24m.  It copies the contents of each [4mfile[24m to the standard
       output stream, except that lines between [1m.TS [22mand [1m.TE [22mare interpreted as
       table  descriptions.  While GNU [4mtbl[24m’s input syntax is highly compatible
       with AT&T [4mtbl[24m, the output GNU [4mtbl[24m produces cannot be processed by  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m;  GNU [4mtroff[24m (or a [4mtroff[24m implementing any GNU extensions employed)
       must be used.  Normally, [4mtbl[24m is not executed directly by the user,  but
       invoked  by  specifying the [1m-t [22moption to [4mgroff[24m(1).  If no [4mfile[24m operands
       are given on the command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, [4mtbl[24m reads  the  stan‐
       dard input stream.

   [1mOverview[0m
       [4mtbl[24m  expects  to find table descriptions between input lines that begin
       with [1m.TS [22m(table start) and [1m.TE [22m(table end).  Each such [4mtable[24m [4mregion[24m en‐
       closes  one  or  more table descriptions.  Within a table region, table
       descriptions beyond the first must each be preceded by  an  input  line
       beginning  with [1m.T&[22m.  This mechanism does not start a new table region;
       all table descriptions are treated as part of their [1m.TS[22m/[1m.TE  [22menclosure,
       even  if  they  are boxed or have column headings that repeat on subse‐
       quent pages (see below).

       (Experienced [4mroff[24m users should observe that [4mtbl[24m is not a [4mroff[24m  language
       interpreter:  the default control character must be used, and no spaces
       or tabs are permitted between the control character and the macro name.
       These  [4mtbl[24m  input  tokens remain as‐is in the output, where they become
       ordinary macro calls.  Macro packages  often  define  [1mTS[22m,  [1mT&[22m,  and  [1mTE[0m
       macros  to  handle issues of table placement on the page.  [4mtbl[24m produces
       [4mgroff[24m code to define these macros as empty if their definitions do  not
       exist when the formatter encounters a table region.)

       Each  table  region may begin with [4mregion[24m [4moptions,[24m and must contain one
       or more [4mtable[24m [4mdefinitions;[24m each  table  definition  contains  a  [4mformat[0m
       [4mspecification[24m  followed  by  one or more input lines (rows) of [4mentries.[0m
       These entries comprise the [4mtable[24m [4mdata.[0m

   [1mRegion options[0m
       The line immediately following the [1m.TS [22mtoken  may  specify  region  op‐
       tions,  keywords  that influence the interpretation or rendering of the
       region as a whole or all  table  entries  within  it  indiscriminately.
       They  must be separated by commas, spaces, or tabs.  Those that require
       a parenthesized argument permit spaces and tabs  between  the  option’s
       name and the opening parenthesis.  Options accumulate and cannot be un‐
       set within a region once declared; if an option that takes a  parameter
       is  repeated, the last occurrence controls.  If present, the set of re‐
       gion options must be terminated with a semicolon ([1m;[22m).

       Any of the [1mallbox[22m, [1mbox[22m, [1mdoublebox[22m, [1mframe[22m, and  [1mdoubleframe  [22mregion  op‐
       tions makes a table “boxed” for the purpose of later discussion.

       [1mallbox [22mEnclose each table entry in a box; implies [1mbox[22m.

       [1mbox    [22mEnclose  the  entire table region in a box.  As a GNU extension,
              the alternative option name [1mframe [22mis also recognized.

       [1mcenter [22mCenter the table region with respect to the current  indentation
              and  line length; the default is to left‐align it.  As a GNU ex‐
              tension, the alternative option name [1mcentre [22mis also recognized.

       [1mdecimalpoint([4m[22mc[24m[1m)[0m
              Recognize character [4mc[24m as the decimal separator in columns  using
              the  [1mN [22m(numeric) classifier (see subsection “Column classifiers”
              below).  This is a GNU extension.

              Recognize characters [4mx[24m and [4my[24m as start and  end  delimiters,  re‐
              spectively,  for [4meqn[24m(1) input, and ignore input between them.  [4mx[0m
              and [4my[24m need not be distinct.

       [1mdoublebox[0m
              Enclose the entire table region in a double  box;  implies  [1mbox[22m.
              As  a  GNU extension, the alternative option name [1mdoubleframe [22mis
              also recognized.

       [1mexpand [22mSpread the table horizontally to fill the available space  (line
              length  minus indentation) by increasing column separation.  Or‐
              dinarily, a table is made only as wide as necessary to  accommo‐
              date  the  widths  of  its  entries  and  its column separations
              (whether specified or default).  When [1mexpand [22mapplies to a  table
              that  exceeds  the available horizontal space, column separation
              is reduced as far as necessary (even  to  zero).   [4mtbl[24m  produces
              [4mgroff[24m input that issues a diagnostic if such compression occurs.
              The column modifier [1mx [22m(see below) overrides this option.

       [1mlinesize([4m[22mn[24m[1m)[0m
              Draw lines or  rules  (e.g.,  from  [1mbox[22m)  with  a  thickness  of
              [4mn[24m  points.  The default is the current type size when the region
              begins.  This option is ignored on terminal devices.

       [1mnokeep [22mDon’t use [4mroff[24m diversions to manage page breaks.  Normally,  [4mtbl[0m
              employs  them to avoid breaking a page within a table row.  This
              usage can sometimes interact badly with macro packages’ own  use
              of  diversions—when  footnotes, for example, are employed.  This
              is a GNU extension.

       [1mnospaces[0m
              Ignore leading and trailing spaces in table entries.  This is  a
              GNU extension.

       [1mnowarn [22mSuppress  diagnostic  messages  produced  at document formatting
              time when the line or page lengths are inadequate to  contain  a
              table row.  This is a GNU extension.

       [1mtab([4m[22mc[24m[1m) [22mUse  the  character  [4mc[24m instead of a tab to separate entries in a
              row of table data.

   [1mTable format specification[0m
       The table format specification is mandatory: it determines  the  number
       of columns in the table and directs how the entries within it are to be
       typeset.  The format specification is a series of  column  [4mdescriptors.[0m
       Each  descriptor  encodes  a  [4mclassifier[24m followed by zero or more [4mmodi‐[0m
       [4mfiers.[24m  Classifiers  are  letters  (recognized  case‐insensitively)  or
       punctuation  symbols; modifiers consist of or begin with letters or nu‐
       merals.  Spaces, tabs, newlines, and commas separate descriptors.  New‐
       lines and commas are special; they apply the descriptors following them
       to a subsequent row of the table.  (This enables column headings to  be
       centered  or  emboldened  while the table entries for the data are not,
       for instance.)  We term the resulting group of column descriptors a [4mrow[0m
       [4mdefinition.[24m   Within  a  row  definition, separation between column de‐
       scriptors (by spaces or tabs) is often optional; only  some  modifiers,
       described below, make separation necessary.

       Each  column descriptor begins with a mandatory [4mclassifier,[24m a character
       that selects from one of several arrangements.  Some determine the  po‐
       sitioning  of  table entries within a rectangular cell: centered, left‐
       aligned, numeric (aligned to a configurable decimal separator), and  so
       on.   Others  perform special operations like drawing lines or spanning
       entries from adjacent cells in the table.  Except for “[1m|[22m”, any  classi‐
       fier  can be followed by one or more [4mmodifiers;[24m some of these accept an
       argument, which in GNU [4mtbl[24m  can  be  parenthesized.   Modifiers  select
       fonts, set the type size, and perform other tasks described below.

       The format specification can occupy multiple input lines, but must con‐
       clude with a dot “[1m.[22m” followed by a newline.  Each row definition is ap‐
       plied  in turn to one row of the table.  The last row definition is ap‐
       plied to rows of table data in excess of the row definitions.

       For clarity in this document’s examples, we shall write classifiers  in
       uppercase  and  modifiers  in  lowercase.  Thus, “[1mCbCb,LR.[22m” defines two
       rows of two columns.  The first row’s entries are  centered  and  bold‐
       faced;  the  second  and any further rows’ first and second columns are
       left‐ and right‐aligned, respectively.

       The row definition with the most column descriptors determines the num‐
       ber  of  columns in the table; any row definition with fewer is implic‐
       itly extended on the right‐hand side with [1mL [22mclassifiers as  many  times
       as necessary to make the table rectangular.

   [1mColumn classifiers[0m
       The [1mL[22m, [1mR[22m, and [1mC [22mclassifiers are the easiest to understand and use.

       [1mA[22m, [1ma   [22mCenter  longest  entry  in this column, left‐align remaining en‐
              tries in the column with respect to the centered entry, then in‐
              dent  all  entries  by one en.  Such “alphabetic” entries (hence
              the name of the classifier) can be used in the same column as [1mL[22m‐
              classified  entries,  as  in  “[1mLL,AR.[22m”.  The [1mA [22mentries are often
              termed “sub‐columns” due to their indentation.

       [1mC[22m, [1mc   [22mCenter entry within the column.

       [1mL[22m, [1ml   [22mLeft‐align entry within the column.

       [1mN[22m, [1mn   [22mNumerically align entry in the column.  [4mtbl[24m  aligns  columns  of
              numbers vertically at the units place.  If multiple decimal sep‐
              arators are adjacent to a digit, it uses the rightmost  one  for
              vertical  alignment.   If  there  is  no  decimal separator, the
              rightmost digit is used for vertical alignment;  otherwise,  [4mtbl[0m
              centers  the  entry within the column.  The [4mroff[24m dummy character
              [1m\& [22min an entry marks the glyph preceding  it  (if  any)  as  the
              units  place; if multiple instances occur in the data, the left‐
              most is used for alignment.

              If [1mN[22m‐classified entries share a column with [1mL [22mor [1mR [22mentries,  [4mtbl[0m
              centers the widest [1mN [22mentry with respect to the widest [1mL [22mor [1mR [22men‐
              try, preserving the alignment of [1mN [22mentries with respect to  each
              other.

              The  appearance of [4meqn[24m equations within [1mN[22m‐classified columns can
              be troublesome due to the foregoing textual scan for  a  decimal
              separator.   Use  the [1mdelim [22mregion option to make [4mtbl[24m ignore the
              data within [4meqn[24m delimiters for that purpose.

              row.

       [1m_[22m, [1m-   [22mReplace  table entry with a horizontal rule.  An empty table en‐
              try is expected to correspond to this classifier;  if  data  are
              found there, [4mtbl[24m issues a diagnostic message.

       [1m=      [22mReplace table entry with a double horizontal rule.  An empty ta‐
              ble entry is expected to correspond to this classifier; if  data
              are found there, [4mtbl[24m issues a diagnostic message.

       [1m|      [22mPlace a vertical rule (line) on the corresponding row of the ta‐
              ble (if two of these are  adjacent,  a  double  vertical  rule).
              This  classifier  does not contribute to the column count and no
              table entries correspond to it.  A [1m| [22mto the left  of  the  first
              column  descriptor  or  to  the right of the last one produces a
              vertical rule at the edge of the table; these are redundant (and
              ignored) in boxed tables.

       To  change  the  table format within a [4mtbl[24m region, use the [1m.T& [22mtoken at
       the start of a line.  It is followed by a format specification and  ta‐
       ble data, but [4mnot[24m region options.  The quantity of columns in a new ta‐
       ble format thus introduced cannot increase relative to the previous ta‐
       ble  format;  in that case, you must end the table region and start an‐
       other.  If that will not serve because the region uses box  options  or
       the columns align in an undesirable manner, you must design the initial
       table format specification to include the maximum quantity  of  columns
       required,  and use the [1mS [22mhorizontal spanning classifier where necessary
       to achieve the desired columnar alignment.

       Attempting to horizontally span in the first column or vertically  span
       on  the first row is an error.  Non‐rectangular span areas are also not
       supported.

   [1mColumn modifiers[0m
       Any number of modifiers can follow a column classifier.   Arguments  to
       modifiers, where accepted, are case‐sensitive.  If the same modifier is
       applied to a column specifier more than once, or if  conflicting  modi‐
       fiers are applied, only the last occurrence has effect.  The modifier [1mx[0m
       is mutually exclusive with [1me [22mand [1mw[22m, but [1me  [22mis  not  mutually  exclusive
       with  [1mw[22m; if these are used in combination, [1mx [22munsets both [1me [22mand [1mw[22m, while
       either [1me [22mor [1mw [22moverrides [1mx[22m.

              starting with a digit), font mounting position (a single digit),
              or a name or mounting position of  any  length  in  parentheses.
              The last form is a GNU extension.  (The parameter corresponds to
              that accepted by the [4mtroff[24m [1mft [22mrequest.)  A  one‐character  argu‐

       [1mm[22m, [1mM   [22mCall a [4mgroff[24m macro before typesetting a text block (see  subsec‐
              tion “Text blocks” below).  This is a GNU extension.  This modi‐
              fier must be followed by a macro name of one or  two  characters
              or  a  name of any length in parentheses.  A one‐character macro
              name not in parentheses must be separated by one or more  spaces
              or  tabs from what follows.  The named macro must be defined be‐
              fore the table region containing this column modifier is encoun‐
              tered.   The  macro should contain only simple [4mgroff[24m requests to
              change text formatting, like  adjustment  or  hyphenation.   The
              macro  is  called  [4mafter[24m  the column modifiers [1mb[22m, [1mf[22m, [1mi[22m, [1mp[22m, and [1mv[0m
              take effect; it can thus override other column modifiers.

       [1mp[22m, [1mP   [22mSet the type size for the table entry.  This  modifier  must  be
              followed  by an integer [4mn[24m with an optional leading sign.  If un‐
              signed, the type size is set to [4mn[24m scaled points.  Otherwise, the
              type size is incremented or decremented per the sign by [4mn[24m scaled
              points.  The use of a signed multi‐digit number is a GNU  exten‐
              sion.   (The parameter corresponds to that accepted by the [4mtroff[0m
              [1mps [22mrequest.)  If a type size modifier is followed  by  a  column
              separation  modifier  (see  below), they must be separated by at
              least one space or tab.

       [1mt[22m, [1mT   [22mAlign a vertically spanned table entry to the  top,  instead  of

       [1mv[22m, [1mV   [22mSet the vertical spacing to be used in a text block.  This modi‐
              fier  must  be followed by an integer [4mn[24m with an optional leading
              sign.  If unsigned, the vertical spacing is  set  to  [4mn[24m  points.
              Otherwise,  the  vertical  spacing is incremented or decremented
              per the sign by [4mn[24m points.  The use of a signed multi‐digit  num‐
              ber is a GNU extension.  (This parameter corresponds to that ac‐
              cepted by the [4mtroff[24m [1mvs [22mrequest.)  If a vertical spacing modifier
              is  followed  by  a column separation modifier (see below), they
              must be separated by at least one space or tab.

       [1mw[22m, [1mW   [22mSet the column’s minimum width.  This modifier must be  followed
              by a number, which is either a unitless integer, or a [4mroff[24m hori‐
              zontal measurement in parentheses.  Parentheses are required  if
              the  width  is  to be followed immediately by an explicit column
              separation (alternatively, follow the width  with  one  or  more
              spaces  or  tabs).   If  no  unit is specified, ens are assumed.
              This modifier sets the default line length used in a text block.

       [1mx[22m, [1mX   [22mExpand the column.  After computing the column widths,  distrib‐
              ute  any  remaining  line length evenly over all columns bearing
              this modifier.  Applying the [1mx [22mmodifier to more than one  column
              is  a GNU extension.  This modifier sets the default line length
              used in a text block.

       [1mz[22m, [1mZ   [22mIgnore the table entries corresponding to this column for  width
              calculation  purposes; that is, compute the column’s width using
              only the information in its descriptor.

       [4mn[24m      A numeric suffix on a column descriptor sets the separation dis‐
              tance  (in  ens) from the succeeding column; the default separa‐
              tion is [1m3n[22m.  This separation is proportionally multiplied if the
              [1mexpand  [22mregion  option is in effect; in the case of tables wider
              than the output line length, this separation might be  zero.   A
              negative  separation  cannot  be specified.  A separation amount
              after the last column in a row is nonsensical and provokes a di‐
              agnostic from [4mtbl[24m.

   [1mTable data[0m
       The  table  data  come after the format specification.  Each input line
       corresponds to a table row, except that a backslash at  the  end  of  a
       line  of  table  data continues an entry on the next input line.  (Text
       blocks, discussed below, also spread table entries across multiple  in‐
       put lines.)  Table entries within a row are separated in the input by a
       tab character by default; see the [1mtab [22mregion option above.  Excess  en‐
       tries  in  a row of table data (those that have no corresponding column
       descriptor, not even an implicit one arising from rectangularization of
       the table) are discarded with a diagnostic message.  [4mroff[24m control lines
       are accepted between rows of table data and within text blocks.  If you
       wish to visibly mark an empty table entry in the document source, popu‐
       late it with the [1m\& [4m[22mroff[24m dummy character.  The table  data  are  inter‐
       rupted  by  a line consisting of the [1m.T& [22minput token, and conclude with
       the line [1m.TE[22m.

       Ordinarily, a table entry is typeset rigidly.  It is not  filled,  bro‐
       ken,  hyphenated, adjusted, or populated with additional inter‐sentence
       space.  [4mtbl[24m instructs the formatter to measure each table entry  as  it
       occurs  in  the input, updating the width required by its corresponding
       column.  If the [1mz [22mmodifier applies to the column, this  measurement  is
       ignored;  if [1mw [22mapplies and its argument is larger than this width, that
       argument is used instead.   In  contrast  to  conventional  [4mroff[24m  input
       (within a paragraph, say), changes to text formatting, such as font se‐
       lection or vertical spacing, do not persist between entries.

       Several forms of table entry are interpreted specially.

       • If a table row contains only an underscore or equals sign ([1m_ [22mor [1m=[22m), a
         single  or  double  horizontal  rule  (line),  respectively, is drawn
         across the table at that point.

       • A table entry containing only [1m_ [22mor [1m= [22mon an otherwise populated row is
         replaced by a single or double horizontal rule, respectively, joining
         its neighbors.

       • Prefixing a lone underscore or equals sign with a backslash also  has
         meaning.   If a table entry consists only of [1m\_ [22mor [1m\= [22mon an otherwise
         populated row, it is replaced by a single or double horizontal  rule,
         respectively, that does [4mnot[24m (quite) join its neighbors.

       • A table entry consisting of [1m\R[4m[22mx[24m, where [4mx[24m is any [4mroff[24m ordinary or spe‐
         cial character, is replaced by enough repetitions of the glyph corre‐
         sponding  to  [4mx[24m to fill the column, albeit without joining its neigh‐
         bors.

       • On any row but the first, a table entry of [1m\^ [22mcauses the entry  above
         it to span down into the current one.

       On  occasion,  these  special  tokens  may be required as literal table
       data.  To use either [1m_ [22mor [1m= [22mliterally and alone in an entry, prefix  or
       suffix  it with the [4mroff[24m dummy character [1m\&[22m.  To express [1m\_[22m, [1m\=[22m, or [1m\R[22m,
       use a [4mroff[24m escape sequence to interpolate the backslash ([1m\e [22mor  [1m\[rs][22m).
       A reliable way to emplace the [1m\^ [22mglyph sequence within a table entry is
       to use a pair of [4mgroff[24m special character escape sequences ([1m\[rs]\[ha][22m).

       Rows of table entries can be  interleaved  with  [4mgroff[24m  control  lines;
       these  do  not  count as table data.  On such lines the default control
       character ([1m.[22m) must be used (and  not  changed);  the  no‐break  control
       character  is  not recognized.  To start the first table entry in a row
       with a dot, precede it with the [4mroff[24m dummy character [1m\&[22m.

   [1mText blocks[0m
       An ordinary table entry’s contents can make a column, and therefore the
       table,  excessively wide; the table then exceeds the line length of the
       page, and becomes ugly or is exposed to truncation by  the  output  de‐
       vice.   When  a  table  entry  requires  more conventional typesetting,
       breaking across more than one output line (and thereby  increasing  the
       height of its row), it can be placed within a [4mtext[24m [4mblock.[0m

       [4mtbl[24m interprets a table entry beginning with “[1mT{[22m” at the end of an input
       line not as table data, but as a token starting a  text  block.   Simi‐
       larly,  “[1mT}[22m”  at  the start of an input line ends a text block; it must
       also end the table entry.  Text block tokens can share  an  input  line
       with other table data (preceding [1mT{ [22mand following [1mT}[22m).  Input lines be‐
       tween these tokens are formatted in a diversion by [4mtroff[24m.  Text  blocks
       cannot be nested.  Multiple text blocks can occur in a table row.

       Text  blocks are formatted as was the text prior to the table, modified
       by applicable column descriptors.  Specifically, the classifiers [1mA[22m,  [1mC[22m,
       [1mL[22m,  [1mN[22m, [1mR[22m, and [1mS [22mdetermine a text block’s [4malignment[24m within its cell, but
       not its [4madjustment.[24m  Add [1mna [22mor [1mad [22mrequests to the beginning of  a  text
       block  to  alter its adjustment distinctly from other text in the docu‐
       ment.  As with other table entries, when a text block ends, any  alter‐
       ations to formatting parameters are discarded.  They do not affect sub‐
       sequent table entries, not even other text blocks.

       If [1mw [22mor [1mx [22mmodifiers are not specified for [4mall[24m columns of a text block’s
       span,  the  default  length of the text block (more precisely, the line
       length used to  process  the  text  block  diversion)  is  computed  as
       [4mL[24m×[4mC[24m/([4mN[24m+1),  where [4mL[24m is the current line length, [4mC[24m the number of columns
       spanned by the text block, and [4mN[24m the number of columns  in  the  table.
       If necessary, you can also control a text block’s width by including an
       [1mll [22m(line length) request in it prior to any text to be formatted.   Be‐
       cause  a  diversion  is  used  to format the text block, its height and
       width are subsequently available in the registers [1mdn  [22mand  [1mdl[22m,  respec‐
       tively.

   [4m[1mroff[24m interface[0m
       The register [1mTW [22mstores the width of the table region in basic units; it
       can’t be used within the region itself, but is defined before  the  [1m.TE[0m
       token  is output so that a [4mgroff[24m macro named [1mTE [22mcan make use of it.  [1mT.[0m
       is a Boolean‐valued register indicating whether the bottom of the table
       is being processed.  The [1m#T [22mregister marks the top of the table.  Avoid
       using these names for any other purpose.

       [4mtbl[24m also defines a macro [1mT# [22mto produce the bottom and side lines  of  a
       boxed  table.   While  [4mtbl[24m  itself arranges for the output to include a
       call of this macro at the end of such a table, it can also be  used  by
       macro packages to create boxes for multi‐page tables by calling it from
       a page footer macro that is itself called by a trap  planted  near  the
       bottom of the page.  See section “Limitations” below for more on multi‐
       page tables.

       GNU [4mtbl[24m internally employs register, string, macro, and diversion names
       beginning  with  the numeral [1m3[22m.  A document to be preprocessed with GNU
       [4mtbl[24m should not use any such identifiers.

   [1mInteraction with [4meqn[0m
       [4mtbl[24m should always be called  before  [4meqn[24m(1).   ([4mgroff[24m(1)  automatically
       arranges preprocessors in the correct order.)  Don’t call the [1mEQ [22mand [1mEN[0m
       macros within tables; instead, set up delimiters in your [4meqn[24m input  and
       use the [1mdelim [22mregion option so that [4mtbl[24m will recognize them.

   [1mGNU [4mtbl[24m enhancements[0m
       In  addition to extensions noted above, GNU [4mtbl[24m removes constraints en‐
       dured by users of AT&T [4mtbl[24m.

       • Region options can be specified in any lettercase.

       • There is no limit on the number of columns in a table, regardless  of
         their classification, nor any limit on the number of text blocks.

       • All  table  rows are considered when deciding column widths, not just
         those occurring in the first 200 input lines of a region.  Similarly,
         table  continuation  ([1m.T&[22m)  tokens  are recognized outside a region’s
         first 200 input lines.

       • Numeric and alphabetic entries may appear in the same column.

       • Numeric and alphabetic entries may span horizontally.

   [1mUsing GNU [4mtbl[24m within macros[0m
       You can embed a table region inside a macro definition.  However, since
       [4mtbl[24m writes its own macro definitions at the beginning of each table re‐
       gion, it is necessary to call end macros instead of ending macro defin‐
       itions with “[1m..[22m”.  Additionally, the escape character must be disabled.

       Not all [4mtbl[24m features can be exercised from such macros because [4mtbl[24m is a
       [4mroff[24m preprocessor: it sees the input earlier than [4mtroff[24m does.  For  ex‐
       ample, vertically aligning decimal separators fails if the numbers con‐
       taining them occur as macro or string parameters; the alignment is per‐
       formed  by  [4mtbl[24m itself, which sees only [1m\$1[22m, [1m\$2[22m, and so on, and there‐
       fore can’t recognize a decimal separator that only appears  later  when
       [4mtroff[24m interpolates a macro or string definition.

       Using  [4mtbl[24m macros within conditional input (that is, contingent upon an
       [1mif[22m, [1mie[22m, [1mel[22m, or [1mwhile [22mrequest) can result in misleading line numbers  in
       subsequent  diagnostics.   [4mtbl[24m  unconditionally injects its output into
       the source document, but the conditional branch containing it  may  not
       be taken, and if it is not, the [1mlf [22mrequests that [4mtbl[24m injects to restore
       the source line number cannot take effect.  Consider copying the  input
       line  counter register [1mc. [22mand restoring its value at a convenient loca‐
       tion after applicable arithmetic.

              more, interpret the uninterpreted leader escape sequence [1m\a[22m.

[1mLimitations[0m
       Multi‐page  tables,  if  boxed and/or if you want their column headings
       repeated after page breaks, require support at the time the document is
       formatted.   A convention for such support has arisen in macro packages
       such as [4mms[24m, [4mmm[24m, and [4mme[24m.  To use it, follow the [1m.TS [22mtoken with  a  space
       and  then  “[1mH[22m”; this will be interpreted by the formatter as a [1mTS [22mmacro
       call with an [1mH [22margument.  Then, within the  table  data,  call  the  [1mTH[0m
       macro;  this informs the macro package where the headings end.  If your
       table has no such heading rows, or you do not desire their  repetition,
       call  [1mTH [22mimmediately after the table format specification.  If a multi‐
       page table is boxed or has repeating column headings, do not enclose it
       with  keep/release macros, or divert it in any other way.  Further, the
       [1mbp [22mrequest will not cause a page break in a “[1mTS  H[22m”  table.   Define  a
       macro  to wrap [1mbp[22m: invoke it normally if there is no current diversion.
       Otherwise, pass the macro call to the  enclosing  diversion  using  the
       transparent  line  escape  sequence  [1m\![22m; this will “bubble up” the page
       break to the output device.  See section “Examples” below for a  demon‐
       stration.

       Double  horizontal  rules  are not supported by [4mgrotty[24m(1); single rules
       are used instead.  [4mgrotty[24m also ignores half‐line motions, so the [1mu [22mcol‐
       umn  modifier has no effect.  On terminal devices (“[4mnroff[24m mode”), hori‐
       zontal rules and box borders occupy a full vee of space; this amount is
       doubled for [1mdoublebox [22mtables.  Tables using these features thus require
       more vertical space in [4mnroff[24m mode than in [4mtroff[24m mode: write [1mne [22mrequests
       accordingly.  Vertical rules between columns are drawn in the space be‐
       tween columns in [4mnroff[24m mode; using double vertical rules and/or  reduc‐
       ing the column separation below the default can make them ugly or over‐
       strike them with table data.

       A text block within a table must be able to fit on one page.

       Using [1m\a [22mto put leaders in table entries does not work in GNU [4mtbl[24m,  ex‐
       cept  in  compatibility mode.  This is correct behavior: [1m\a [22mis an [4munin‐[0m
       [4mterpreted[24m leader.  You can still use the [4mroff[24m  leader  character  (Con‐
       trol+A)  or  define a string to use [1m\a [22mas it was designed: to be inter‐
       preted only in copy mode.

       [4mtfmtodit[24m creates a font description file for use  with  [4mgroff[24m(1)’s  [1mdvi[0m
       output  device.   [4mtfm‐file[24m  is the name of the TeX font metric file for
       the font.  [4mmap‐file[24m assigns [4mgroff[24m ordinary or special character identi‐
       fiers  to glyph indices in the font; it should consist of a sequence of
       lines of the form
              [4mi[24m [4mc1[24m ... [4mcn[0m
       where [4mi[24m is a position of the glyph in  the  font  in  decimal,  and  [4mc1[0m
       through  [4mcn[24m  are  glyph  identifiers in the form used by [4mgroff[24m font de‐
       scriptions.  If a glyph has no [4mgroff[24m names but exists in  [4mtfm‐file,[24m  it
       is  put in the [4mgroff[24m font description file as an unnamed glyph.  Output
       is written in [4mgroff_font[24m(5) format to [4mfont‐description,[24m  a  file  named
       for the intended [4mgroff[24m font name.

       If  the font is “special”, meaning that [4mgroff[24m should search it whenever
       a glyph is not found in the current font, use the [1m-s  [22moption  and  name
       [4mfont‐description[24m  in  the  [1mfonts  [22mdirective in the output device’s [4mDESC[0m
       file.

       To do a good job of math typesetting, [4mgroff[24m requires font metric infor‐
       mation  not present in [4mtfm‐file.[24m  This is because TeX has separate math
       italic fonts, whereas [4mgroff[24m uses normal italic fonts for math.  The ad‐
       ditional information required by [4mgroff[24m is given by the two arguments to
       the [1mmath_fit [22mmacro in the Metafont programs  for  the  Computer  Modern
       fonts.   In  a text font (a font for which [1mmath_fit [22mis false), Metafont
       normally ignores these two arguments.  Metafont can be made to put this
       information  into  the GF (“generic font”) files it produces by loading
       the following definition after [1mcmbase [22mwhen creating [4mcm.base[24m.
              def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
                  special "adjustment";
                  numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  enddef;
       For the EC font family, load the  following  definition  after  [1mexbase[22m;
       consider patching [4mexbase.mf[24m locally.
              def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
                  ori_special "adjustment";
                  ori_numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  ori_numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  enddef;
       The  only  difference from the previous example is the “ori_” prefix to
       “special” and “numspecial”.  The GF file created  using  this  modified
       [4mcm.base[24m  or  [4mexbase.mf[24m  should  be  specified with the [1m-g [22moption, which
       should [4mnot[24m be given for a font for which [1mmath_fit [22mis true.

[1mDescription[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m transforms [4mgroff[24m(7) language input into  the  device‐indepen‐
       dent  output  format described in [4mgroff_out[24m(5); [4mtroff[24m is thus the heart
       of the GNU [4mroff[24m document formatting system.  If no  [4mfile[24m  operands  are
       given on the command line, or if [4mfile[24m is “[1m-[22m”, the standard input stream
       is read.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m is functionally compatible with the AT&T [4mtroff[24m typesetter and
       features  numerous  extensions.  Many people prefer to use the [4mgroff[24m(1)
       command, a front end which also runs preprocessors and  output  drivers
       in the appropriate order and with appropriate options.

              of abstract preview of the formatted output.

              • Page breaks are marked by a phrase in angle brackets; for  ex‐
                ample, “<beginning of page>”.

              • Lines are broken where they would be in the formatted output.

              • A  horizontal  motion of any size is represented as one space.
                Adjacent horizontal motions are not combined.   Inter‐sentence
                space nodes (those arising from the second argument to the [1m.ss[0m
                request) are not represented.

              • Vertical motions are not represented.

              • Special characters are rendered in angle brackets;  for  exam‐
                ple, the default soft hyphen character appears as “<hy>”.

              The  above description should not be considered a specification;
              the details of [1m-a [22moutput are subject to change.

              because [4mtroff[24m’s idea of line numbers can be confused by requests
              that append to macros.

       groff_font - GNU [4mroff[24m device and font description files

[1mDescription[0m
       The [4mgroff[24m font and output device description formats are slight  exten‐
       sions  of  those used by AT&T device‐independent [4mtroff[24m.  In distinction
       to the AT&T implementation, [4mgroff[24m lacks a binary format; all files  are
       text  files.  (Plan 9 [4mtroff[24m has also abandoned the binary format.)  The
       device and font description files for a device [4mname[24m are stored in a [4mde‐[0m
       [4mv[24mname  directory.  The device description file is called [4mDESC[24m, and, for
       each font supported by the device, a font description file is called [4mf,[0m
       where  [4mf[24m is usually an abbreviation of a font’s name and/or style.  For
       example, the [1mps [22m(PostScript) device has [4mgroff[24m  font  description  files
       for Times roman ([1mTR[22m) and Zapf Chancery Medium italic ([1mZCMI[22m), among many
       others, while the [1mutf8 [22mdevice (for terminal emulators)  has  only  font
       descriptions for the roman, italic, bold, and bold‐italic styles ([1mR[22m, [1mI[22m,
       [1mB[22m, and [1mBI[22m, respectively).

       Device and font description files are read by the formatter, [4mtroff[24m, and
       by  output  drivers.  The programs typically delegate these files’ pro‐
       cessing to an internal library, [4mlibgroff[24m, ensuring their consistent in‐
       terpretation.

[4m[1mDESC[24m file format[0m
       The  [4mDESC[24m  file  contains  a  series of directives; each begins a line.
       Their order is not important, with two exceptions: (1) the  [1mres  [22mdirec‐
       tive  must  precede any [1mpapersize [22mdirective; and (2) the [1mcharset [22mdirec‐
       tive must come last (if at all).  If  a  directive  name  is  repeated,
       later entries in the file override previous ones (except that the paper
       dimensions are computed based on  the  [1mres  [22mdirective  last  seen  when
       [1mpapersize  [22mis  encountered).  Spaces and/or tabs separate words and are
       ignored at line boundaries.  Comments start with the “[1m#[22m” character  and
       extend to the end of a line.  Empty lines are ignored.

       [1mfamily [4m[22mfam[0m
              The default font family is [4mfam[24m.

       [1mfonts [4m[22mn[24m [4mF1[24m ... [4mFn[0m
              Fonts  [4mF1[24m,  ...,  [4mFn[24m are mounted at font positions [4mm[24m+1, ..., [4mm[24m+[4mn[0m
              where [4mm[24m is the number of [1mstyles [22m(see below).  This directive may
              extend over more than one line.  A font name of [1m0 [22mcauses no font
              to be mounted at the corresponding position.

       [1mhor [4m[22mn[24m  The horizontal motion quantum  is  [4mn[24m  basic  units.   Horizontal
              quantities are rounded to multiples of [4mn.[0m

              GNU/Linux, this is usually [4mgs[24m(1), but under other  systems  (no‐
              tably  Cygwin)  it might be set to another name.  The [4mgrohtml[24m(1)
              driver uses this directive.

       [1mpaperlength [4m[22mn[0m
              The vertical dimension of the output medium  is  [4mn[24m  basic  units
              (deprecated: use [1mpapersize [22minstead).

       [1mpapersize [4m[22mformat‐or‐dimension‐pair‐or‐file‐name[24m ...
              The  dimensions of the output medium are as according to the ar‐
              gument, which is either a standard paper format, a pair  of  di‐
              mensions,  or the name of a plain text file containing either of
              the foregoing.  Recognized paper formats are  the  ISO  and  DIN
              formats [1mA0[22m–[1mA7[22m, [1mB0[22m–[1mB7[22m, [1mC0[22m–[1mC7[22m, and [1mD0[22m–[1mD7[22m; the U.S. formats [1mletter[22m,
              [1mlegal[22m, [1mtabloid[22m, [1mledger[22m, [1mstatement[22m, and [1mexecutive[22m; and the  enve‐
              lope  formats  [1mcom10[22m,  [1mmonarch[22m,  and  [1mDL[22m.  Matching is performed
              without regard for lettercase.

              Alternatively,  the  argument  can  be  a  custom  paper  format
              [4mlength[24m[1m,[4m[22mwidth[24m  (with  no spaces before or after the comma).  Both
              [4mlength[24m and [4mwidth[24m must have a unit appended; valid units are  “[1mi[22m”
              for inches, “[1mc[22m” for centimeters, “[1mp[22m” for points, and “[1mP[22m” for pi‐
              cas.  Example: “[1m12c,235p[22m”.  An argument that starts with a digit
              is always treated as a custom paper format.

              Finally, the argument can be a file name (e.g., [4m/etc/papersize[24m);
              if the file can be opened, the first line is read  and  a  match
              attempted  against  each  other form.  No comment syntax is sup‐
              ported.

              More than one argument can be specified; each is scanned in turn
              and the first valid paper specification used.

       [1mpaperwidth [4m[22mn[0m
              The  horizontal  dimension of the output medium is [4mn[24m basic units

              [4mgroff[24m is used.  However, if there are entries in a font descrip‐
              tion  file’s  [1mcharset  [22msection, they either override the default

       [1mcharset[0m
              This directive and the rest of the file are ignored.  It is rec‐
              ognized for compatibility with other [4mtroff[24m implementations.   In
              GNU  [4mtroff[24m,  character set repertoire is described on a per‐font
              basis.

       [4mtroff[24m  recognizes  but  ignores  the  directives  [1mspare1[22m,  [1mspare2[22m,  and
       [1mbiggestfont[22m.

       The  [1mres[22m,  [1munitwidth[22m, [1mfonts[22m, and [1msizes [22mlines are mandatory.  Directives
       not listed above are ignored by [4mtroff[24m but may be used by postprocessors
       to obtain further information about the device.

[1mFont description file format[0m
       On typesetting output devices, each font is typically available at mul‐
       tiple sizes.  While paper measurements in the device  description  file
       are in absolute units, measurements applicable to fonts must be propor‐
       tional to the type size.  [4mgroff[24m achieves this using the  precedent  set
       by  AT&T  device‐independent  [4mtroff[24m: one font size is chosen as a norm,
       and all others are scaled linearly relative to that basis.   The  “unit
       width” is the number of basic units per point when the font is rendered
       at this nominal size.

       For instance, [4mgroff[24m’s [1mlbp [22mdevice uses a [1munitwidth [22mof  800.   Its  Times
       roman  font  (“[1mTR[22m”)  has a [1mspacewidth [22mof 833; this is also the width of
       its comma, period, centered period, and  mathematical  asterisk,  while
       its  “M” is 2,963 basic units.  Thus, an “M” on the [1mlbp [22mdevice is 2,963
       basic units wide at a notional type size  of  800  points.   (800‐point
       type is not practical for most purposes, but using it enables the quan‐
       tities in the font description files to be expressed as integers.)

       A font description file has two sections.  The first is a  sequence  of
       directives,  and  is parsed similarly to the [4mDESC[24m file described above.
       Except for the directive names that begin the second section, their or‐
       dering  is immaterial.  Later directives of the same name override ear‐
       lier ones, spaces and tabs are handled in the same way,  and  the  same
       comment syntax is supported.  Empty lines are ignored throughout.

       [1mname [4m[22mF[24m The  name  of  the  font  is [4mF[24m.  “[1mDESC[22m” is an invalid font name.
              Simple integers are valid, but their use is discouraged.  ([4mgroff[0m
              requests  and escape sequences interpret non‐negative font names
              as mounting positions instead.  Further, a font named “[1m0[22m” cannot
              be automatically mounted by the [1mfonts [22mdirective of a [4mDESC[24m file.)

       [1mspacewidth [4m[22mn[0m
              The width of an unadjusted inter‐word space is [4mn[24m basic units.

       The  directives above must appear in the first section; those below are
       optional.

       [1mslant [4m[22mn[0m
              The font’s glyphs have a slant of [4mn[24m degrees; a positive [4mn[24m slants
              in the direction of text flow.

       [1mligatures [4m[22mlig1[24m ... [4mlign[24m [[1m0[22m]
              Glyphs [4mlig1[24m, ..., [4mlign[24m are ligatures; possible ligatures are [1mff[22m,
              [1mfi[22m, [1mfl[22m, [1mffi[22m, and [1mffl[22m.  For compatibility with other [4mtroff[24m imple‐
              mentations,  the  list  of ligatures may be terminated with a [1m0[22m.
              The list of ligatures must not extend over more than one line.

       [1mspecial[0m
              The font is [4mspecial[24m: when a  glyph  is  requested  that  is  not
              present  in  the current font, it is sought in any mounted fonts
              that bear this property.

       Other directives in this section are ignored by [4mtroff[24m, but may be  used
       by postprocessors to obtain further information about the font.

       The  second  section contains one or two subsections.  These can appear
       in either order; the first one encountered commences  the  second  sec‐
       tion.   Each  starts  with  a directive on a line by itself.  A [1mcharset[0m
       subsection is mandatory unless the associated [4mDESC[24m  file  contains  the
       [1municode [22mdirective.  Another subsection, [1mkernpairs[22m, is optional.

       The  directive [1mcharset [22mstarts the character set subsection.  (For type‐
       setter devices, this directive is misnamed since it starts  a  list  of
       glyphs,  not  characters.)  It precedes a series of glyph descriptions,
       one per line.  Each such glyph description comprises a  set  of  fields
       separated by spaces or tabs and organized as follows.

              [4mname[24m [4mmetrics[24m [4mtype[24m [4mcode[24m [[4mentity‐name[24m] [[1m-- [4m[22mcomment[24m]

       [4mname[24m  identifies the glyph: if [4mname[24m is a printable character [4mc[24m, it cor‐
       responds to the [4mtroff[24m ordinary character [4mc[24m.  If [4mname[24m is a multi‐charac‐
       ter sequence not beginning with [1m\[22m, it corresponds to the GNU [4mtroff[24m spe‐
       cial character escape sequence “[1m\[[4m[22mname[24m[1m][22m”.  A name consisting  of  three
       minus  signs,  “[1m---[22m”,  indicates that the glyph is unnamed: such glyphs
       can be accessed only by the [1m\N [22mescape sequence  in  [4mtroff[24m.   A  special
       character  named “[1m---[22m” can still be defined using [1m.char [22mand similar re‐
       quests.  The [4mname[24m “[1m\-[22m” defines the minus sign glyph.  Finally, [4mname[24m can
       be the horizontal motion escape sequences, [1m\| [22mand [1m\^ [22m(“thin” and “hair”
       spaces, respectively), in which case only the  width  metric  described
       below is applied; a font can thus customize the widths of these spaces.

       The  form  of  the  [4mmetrics[24m field is as follows (on one line; it may be
       broken here for readability).

              [4mwidth[24m[[1m,[22m[[4mheight[24m[[1m,[22m[[4mdepth[24m[[1m,[22m[[4mitalic‐correction[24m[[1m,[22m[
              [4mleft‐italic‐correction[24m[[1m,[22m[[4msubscript‐correction[24m]]]]]]]]]]

       There  must  not  be  any  spaces, tabs, or newlines between these [4msub‐[0m
       [4mfields,[24m which are in basic units expressed as  decimal  integers.   Un‐
       specified  subfields default to [1m0[22m.  Since there is no associated binary
       format, these values are not required to fit into the C  language  data
       type [1mchar [22mas they are in AT&T device‐independent [4mtroff[24m.

       The  [4mwidth[24m  subfield gives the width of the glyph.  The [4mheight[24m subfield
       gives the height of the glyph (upwards is positive); if  a  glyph  does
       not extend above the baseline, it should be given a zero height, rather
       than a negative height.  The [4mdepth[24m subfield  gives  the  depth  of  the
       glyph,  that is, the distance below the baseline to which the glyph ex‐
       tends (downwards is positive); if a glyph does  not  extend  below  the
       baseline,  it  should  be  given  a  zero depth, rather than a negative
       depth.  Italic corrections are relevant to glyphs in italic or  oblique
       styles.   The  [4mitalic‐correction[24m  is the amount of space that should be
       added after an oblique glyph to be followed immediately by  an  upright
       glyph.   The  [4mleft‐italic‐correction[24m is the amount of space that should
       be added before an oblique glyph to be preceded immediately by  an  up‐
       right  glyph.   The  [4msubscript‐correction[24m  is  the amount of space that
       should be added after an oblique glyph to be followed by  a  subscript;
       it should be less than the italic correction.

       For  fonts  used with typesetting devices, the [4mtype[24m field gives a feat‐
       ural description of the glyph: it is a bit mask recording  whether  the
       glyph  is  an  ascender, descender, both, or neither.  When a [1m\w [22mescape
       sequence is interpolated, these values are bitwise or‐ed  together  for
       each  glyph  and  stored  in the [1mct [22mregister.  In font descriptions for
       terminal devices, all glyphs might have a type of zero,  regardless  of
       their appearance.

       0      means  the  glyph lies entirely between the baseline and a hori‐
              zontal line at the “x‐height” of the font, as with “a”, “c”, and
              “x”;

       1      means the glyph descends below the baseline, like “p”;

       2      means  the  glyph ascends above the font’s x‐height, like “A” or
              “b”); and

       3      means the glyph is both an ascender and a descender—this is true
              of parentheses in some fonts.

       The  [4mcode[24m  field gives a numeric identifier that the postprocessor uses
       to render the glyph.  The glyph can be specified to  [4mtroff[24m  using  this
       code  by  means of the [1m\N [22mescape sequence.  The code can be any integer
       (that is, any integer parsable by the C  standard  library’s  [4mstrtol[24m(3)
       function).

       The  [4mentity‐name[24m  field  defines  an  identifier for the glyph that the
       postprocessor uses to print the [4mtroff[24m glyph [4mname[24m.  This  field  is  op‐
       tional;  it  was introduced so that the [4mgrohtml[24m output driver could en‐
       code its character set.  For example, the glyph [1m\[Po] [22mis represented by
       “[1m&pound;[22m” in HTML 4.0.  For efficiency, these data are now compiled di‐
       rectly into [4mgrohtml[24m.  [4mgrops[24m uses the field to build sub‐encoding arrays
       for  PostScript fonts containing more than 256 glyphs.  Anything on the
       line after the [4mentity‐name[24m field or “[1m--[22m” is ignored.

       A line in the [1mcharset [22msection can also have the form
              [4mname[24m [1m"[0m
       identifying [4mname[24m as another name for the glyph mentioned in the preced‐
       ing line.  Such aliases can be chained.

       The directive [1mkernpairs [22mstarts a list of kerning adjustments to be made
       to adjacent glyph pairs from this font.   It  contains  a  sequence  of
       lines formatted as follows.
              [4mg1[24m [4mg2[24m [4mn[0m
       The  foregoing  means  that when glyph [4mg1[24m is typeset immediately before
       [4mg2[24m, the space between them should be  increased  by  [4mn[24m.   Most  kerning
       pairs should have a negative value for [4mn[24m.

       groff_out - GNU [4mroff[24m intermediate output format

[1mDescription[0m
       The  fundamental operation of the [4mtroff[24m(1) formatter is the translation
       of the [4mgroff[24m(7) input language into a series of instructions  concerned
       primarily  with  placing  glyphs or geometric objects at specific posi‐
       tions on a rectangular page.  In the  following  discussion,  the  term
       [4mcommand[24m  refers  to  this  intermediate  output  language, never to the
       [4mgroff[24m(7) language intended for use by document  authors.   Intermediate
       output commands comprise several categories: glyph output; font, color,
       and text size selection; motion of the printing position; page advance‐
       ment;  drawing  of geometric primitives; and device control commands, a
       catch‐all for other operations.  The last includes directives to  start
       and stop output, identify the intended output device, and embed URL hy‐
       perlinks in supported output formats.

       Because the front‐end command [4mgroff[24m(1) is a wrapper that normally  runs
       the  [4mtroff[24m formatter to generate intermediate output and an output dri‐
       ver (“postprocessor”) to consume it, users normally  do  not  encounter
       this  language.   The [4mgroff[24m program’s [1m-Z [22moption inhibits postprocessing
       such that this intermediate output  is  sent  to  the  standard  output
       stream as when [4mtroff[24m is run manually.

       [4mgroff[24m’s  intermediate output facilitates the development of output dri‐
       vers and other postprocessors by offering a common  programming  inter‐
       face.  It is an extension of the page description language developed by
       Brian Kernighan for AT&T device‐independent [4mtroff[24m circa 1980.  Where  a
       distinction  is  necessary,  we will say “[4mtroff[24m output” to describe the
       output of GNU [4mtroff[24m, and “intermediate output” to denote  the  language
       accepted by the parser implemented in [4mgroff[24m’s internal C++ library used
       by most of its output drivers.

[1mLanguage concepts[0m
       During the run of [4mtroff[24m, the [4mroff[24m input is cracked down to the informa‐
       tion on what has to be printed at what position on the intended device.
       So the language of the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m format can be  quite  small.
       Its only elements are commands with or without arguments.  In this doc‐
       ument, the term “command” always refers to the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m lan‐
       guage,  never to the [4mroff[24m language used for document formatting.  There
       are commands for positioning and text writing, for drawing, and for de‐
       vice controlling.

   [1mSeparation[0m
       [4mClassical[24m  [4mtroff[24m  [4moutput[24m  had  strange requirements on whitespace.  The
       [4mgroff[24m output parser, however, is smart about whitespace  by  making  it
       maximally  optional.   The whitespace characters, i.e., the [4mtab[24m, [4mspace[24m,
       and [4mnewline[24m characters, always have a syntactical  meaning.   They  are
       never printable because spacing within the output is always done by po‐
       sitioning commands.

       Any sequence of [4mspace[24m or [4mtab[24m characters is treated as a single  [4msyntac‐[0m
       [4mtical[24m [4mspace[24m.  It separates commands and arguments, but is only required
       when there would occur a clashing between the command code and the  ar‐
       guments  without  the  space.   Most  often, this happens when variable
       length command names, arguments, argument lists,  or  command  clusters
       meet.   Commands  and  arguments with a known, fixed length need not be
       separated by [4msyntactical[24m [4mspace[24m.

       A line break is a syntactical element, too.  Every command argument can
       be  followed  by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character.  Thus a
       [4msyntactical[24m [4mline[24m [4mbreak[24m is defined to consist  of  optional  [4msyntactical[0m
       [4mspace[24m  that  is optionally followed by a comment, and a newline charac‐
       ter.

       The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a  sin‐
       gle letter taking a fixed number of arguments.  For historical reasons,
       the parser allows stacking of such commands on the same line, but  for‐
       tunately, in [4mgroff[24m [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m, every command with at least one
       argument is followed by a line break, thus  providing  excellent  read‐
       ability.

       The  other commands — those for drawing and device controlling — have a
       more complicated structure; some recognize long command names, and some
       take  a variable number of arguments.  So all [1mD [22mand [1mx [22mcommands were de‐
       signed to request a [4msyntactical[24m [4mline[24m [4mbreak[24m after their  last  argument.
       Only  one  command, ‘[1mx X[22m’ has an argument that can stretch over several
       lines, all other commands must have all of their arguments on the  same
       line  as  the  command,  i.e., the arguments may not be split by a line
       break.

       Lines containing only spaces and/or a comment are treated as empty  and
       ignored.

   [1mArgument units[0m
       Some commands accept integer arguments that represent measurements, but
       the scaling units of the formatter’s language  are  never  used.   Most
       commands assume a scaling unit of “[1mu[22m” (basic units), and others use “[1mz[22m”
       (scaled points); These are defined by the parameters specified  in  the
       device’s  [4mDESC[24m  file; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5) and, for more on scaling units,
       [4mgroff[24m(7) and [4mGroff:[24m [4mThe[24m [4mGNU[24m [4mImplementation[24m [4mof[24m [4mtroff[24m, the [4mgroff[24m  Texinfo
       manual.  Color‐related commands use dimensionless integers.

       Note  that  single  characters  can have the eighth bit set, as can the
       names of fonts and special characters (this is, glyphs).  The names  of
       glyphs  and  fonts  can  be of arbitrary length.  A glyph that is to be
       printed will always be in the current font.

       A string argument is always terminated by the next whitespace character
       (space,  tab,  or newline); an embedded [1m# [22mcharacter is regarded as part
       of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment command.  An integer
       argument  is  already terminated by the next non‐digit character, which
       then is regarded as the first character of the next  argument  or  com‐
       mand.

   [1mDocument parts[0m
       A  correct [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m document consists of two parts, the [4mpro‐[0m
       [4mlogue[24m and the [4mbody[24m.

       The task of the [4mprologue[24m is to set the general device parameters  using
       three  exactly specified commands.  The [4mgroff[24m [4mprologue[24m is guaranteed to
       consist of the following three lines (in that order):

              [1mx T [4m[22mdevice[0m
              [1mx res [4m[22mn[24m [4mh[24m [4mv[0m
              [1mx init[0m

       with the arguments set as outlined in subsection “Device  Control  Com‐
       mands”  below.   However, the parser for the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m format
       is able to swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.

       The [4mbody[24m is the main section for processing the document data.  Syntac‐
       tically,  it is a sequence of any commands different from the ones used
       in the [4mprologue[24m.  Processing is terminated as soon as the first  [1mx stop[0m
       command  is encountered; the last line of any [4mgroff[24m [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[0m
       always contains such a command.

       Semantically, the [4mbody[24m is page oriented.  A new page is  started  by  a
       [1mp  [22mcommand.  Positioning, writing, and drawing commands are always done
       within the current page, so they cannot occur before the first  [1mp  [22mcom‐
       mand.   Absolute positioning (by the [1mH [22mand [1mV [22mcommands) is done relative
       to the current page, all other positioning is done relative to the cur‐
       rent location within this page.

[1mCommand reference[0m
       This  section describes all [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m commands, the classical
       commands as well as the [4mgroff[24m extensions.

   [1mComment command[0m
       [1m#[4m[22manything[24m⟨line‐break⟩
              A comment.  Ignore any characters from the [1m# [22mcharacter up to the
              next newline.  Each comment can be preceded by arbitrary [4msyntac‐[0m
              [4mtical[24m [4mspace[24m; every command can be terminated by a comment.

   [1mSimple commands[0m
       The commands in this subsection have a command  code  consisting  of  a
       single character, taking a fixed number of arguments.  Most of them are
       commands for positioning and text writing.  These  commands  are  smart
       about  whitespace.   Optionally,  [4msyntactical[24m [4mspace[24m can be inserted be‐
       fore, after, and between the command letter and its arguments.  All  of
       these  commands are stackable, i.e., they can be preceded by other sim‐
       ple commands or followed by arbitrary other commands on the same  line.
       A separating [4msyntactical[24m [4mspace[24m is necessary only when two integer argu‐
       ments would clash or if the preceding argument ends with a string argu‐
       ment.

       [1mC [4m[22mid[24m⟨white‐space⟩
              Typeset the glyph of the special character [4mid[24m.  Trailing syntac‐
              tical space is necessary to allow special character names of ar‐
              bitrary length.  The drawing position is not advanced.

       [1mc [4m[22mc[24m    Typeset  the  glyph  of the ordinary character character [4mc[24m.  The
              drawing position is not advanced.

       [1mf [4m[22mn[24m    Select the font mounted at position [4mn[24m.  [4mn[24m cannot be negative.

       [1mH [4m[22mn[24m    Horizontally move the drawing position to [4mn[24m basic units from the
              left edge of the page.  [4mn[24m cannot be negative.

       [1mh [4m[22mn[24m    Move  the  drawing position right [4mn[24m basic units.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m al‐
              lowed negative [4mn;[24m GNU [4mtroff[24m does not produce  such  values,  but
              [4mgroff[24m’s output driver library handles them.

       [1mm [4m[22mscheme[24m [[4mcomponent[24m ...]
              Select  the stroke color using the [4mcomponent[24ms in the color space
              [4mscheme[24m.  Each [4mcomponent[24m is an integer between 0 and 65536.   The
              quantity of components and their meanings vary with each [4mscheme[24m.
              This command is a [4mgroff[24m extension.

              [1mmc [4m[22mcyan[24m [4mmagenta[24m [4myellow[0m
                     Use the CMY color scheme with components  cyan,  magenta,
                     and yellow.

              [1mmd     [22mUse  the  default  color  (no  components;  black in most
                     cases).

              [1mmg [4m[22mgray[0m
                     Use a grayscale color scheme with a component ranging be‐
                     tween 0 (black) and 65536 (white).

              [1mmk [4m[22mcyan[24m [4mmagenta[24m [4myellow[24m [4mblack[0m
                     Use  the CMYK color scheme with components cyan, magenta,
                     yellow, and black.

              [1mmr [4m[22mred[24m [4mgreen[24m [4mblue[0m
                     Use the RGB color scheme with components red, green,  and
                     blue.

       [1mN [4m[22mn[24m    Typeset  the  glyph with index [4mn[24m in the current font.  [4mn[24m is nor‐
              mally a non‐negative integer.  The drawing position is  not  ad‐
              vanced.   The [1mhtml [22mand [1mxhtml [22mdevices use this command with nega‐
              tive [4mn[24m to produce unbreakable space; the absolute value of [4mn[24m  is
              taken and interpreted in basic units.

       [1mn [4m[22mb[24m [4ma[24m  Indicate  a  break.   No  action  is  performed;  the command is
              present to make the output more easily parsed.  The  integers  [4mb[0m
              and  [4ma[24m  describe the vertical space amounts before and after the
              break, respectively.  GNU [4mtroff[24m issues this command but  [4mgroff[24m’s
              output driver library ignores it.  See [1mv [22mand [1mV[22m.

       [1mp [4m[22mn[24m    Begin  a  new page, setting its number to [4mn[24m.  Each page is inde‐
              pendent, even from those using the same  number.   The  vertical
              drawing  position  is  set  to 0.  All positioning, writing, and
              drawing commands are interpreted in the context of a page, so  a
              [1mp [22mcommand must precede them.

       [1ms [4m[22mn[24m    Set  type  size  to [4mn[24m scaled points (unit [1mz [22min GNU [4mtroff[24m).  AT&T
              [4mtroff[24m used unscaled points ([1mp[22m) instead; see section “Compatibil‐
              ity” below.

       [1mt [4m[22mxyz[24m...⟨white‐space⟩
       [1mt [4m[22mxyz[24m... [4mdummy‐arg[24m⟨white‐space⟩
              Typeset  word  [4mxyz[24m;  that  is, set a sequence of ordinary glyphs
              named [4mx[24m, [4my[24m, [4mz[24m, ..., terminated by a space  or  newline;  an  op‐
              tional  second integer argument is ignored (this allows the for‐
              matter to generate an even number of arguments).  Each glyph  is
              set  at  the  current drawing position, and the position is then
              advanced horizontally by the glyph’s width.  A glyph’s width  is
              read  from  its  metrics in the font description file, scaled to
              the current type size, and rounded to a multiple of the horizon‐
              tal motion quantum.  Use the [1mC [22mcommand to emplace glyphs of spe‐
              cial characters.  The [1mt [22mcommand is a [4mgroff[24m extension and is out‐
              put  only  for devices whose [4mDESC[24m file contains the [1mtcommand [22mdi‐
              rective; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       [1mu [4m[22mn[24m [4mxyz[24m...
       [1mu [4m[22mxyz[24m... [4mdummy‐arg[24m⟨white‐space⟩
              Typeset word [4mxyz[24m with track kerning.  As [1mt[22m,  but  after  placing
              each  glyph,  the  drawing position is further advanced horizon‐
              tally by [4mn[24m basic units.  The [1mu [22mcommand is a [4mgroff[24m extension  and
              is output only for devices whose [4mDESC[24m file contains the [1mtcommand[0m
              directive; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       [1mV [4m[22mn[24m    Vertically move the drawing position to [4mn[24m basic units  from  the
              top edge of the page.  [4mn[24m cannot be negative.

       [1mv [4m[22mn[24m    Move  the  drawing  position down [4mn[24m basic units.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m al‐
              lowed negative [4mn;[24m GNU [4mtroff[24m does not produce  such  values,  but
              [4mgroff[24m’s output driver library handles them.

       [1mw      [22mIndicate  an inter‐word space.  No action is performed; the com‐
              mand is present to make the output more easily parsed.  Only ad‐
              justable,  breakable inter‐word spaces are thus described; those
              resulting from [1m\~ [22mor horizontal motion escape sequences are not.
              GNU  [4mtroff[24m issues this command but [4mgroff[24m’s output driver library
              ignores it.  See [1mh [22mand [1mH[22m.

   [1mGraphics commands[0m
       Each graphics or drawing command in the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m starts with
       the  letter  [1mD [22mfollowed by one or two characters that specify a subcom‐
       mand; this is followed by a fixed or variable number of  integer  argu‐
       ments  that are separated by a single space character.  A [1mD [22mcommand may
       not be followed by another command on the same line (apart from a  com‐
       ment), so each [1mD [22mcommand is terminated by a [4msyntactical[24m [4mline[24m [4mbreak[24m.

       [4mtroff[24m output follows the classical spacing rules (no space between com‐
       mand and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single space char‐
       acter),  but  the parser allows optional space between the command let‐
       ters and makes the space before the first argument optional.  As usual,
       each space can be any sequence of tab and space characters.

       Some  graphics  commands  can  take a variable number of arguments.  In
       this case, they are integers representing  a  size  measured  in  basic
       units [1mu[22m.  The [4mh[24m arguments stand for horizontal distances where positive
       means right, negative left.  The [4mv[24m arguments stand  for  vertical  dis‐
       tances where positive means down, negative up.  All these distances are
       offsets relative to the current location.

       Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly  corresponds
       to a similar [4mgroff[24m [1m\D [22mescape sequence; see [4mgroff[24m(7).

       Unknown  [1mD  [22mcommands  are assumed to be device‐specific.  Its arguments
       are parsed as strings; the whole information is then sent to the  post‐
       processor.

       In  the  following  command  reference, the syntax element [4m⟨line‐break⟩[0m
       means a [4msyntactical[24m [4mline[24m [4mbreak[24m as defined  in  subsection  “Separation”
       above.

              Draw  B‐spline from current position to offset ([4mh1[24m, [4mv1[24m), then to
              offset ([4mh2[24m, [4mv2[24m) if given, etc., up  to  ([4mhn[24m, [4mvn[24m).  This  command
              takes  a variable number of argument pairs; the current position
              is moved to the terminal point of the drawn curve.

              (integer  in  basic  units [1mu[22m) with leftmost point at the current
              position; then move the current position to the rightmost  point
              of  the  circle.  An optional second integer argument is ignored
              (this allows the formatter to generate an even number  of  argu‐
              ments).  This command is a [4mgroff[24m extension.

       [1mDc [4m[22md[24m⟨line‐break⟩

   [1mDevice control commands[0m
       Each  device  control  command  starts  with the letter [1mx [22mfollowed by a
       space character (optional or arbitrary space/tab in [4mgroff[24m) and  a  sub‐
       command  letter  or  word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a
       [4msyntactical[24m [4mspace[24m.  All [1mx [22mcommands are terminated by a [4msyntactical[24m [4mline[0m
       [4mbreak[24m;  no device control command can be followed by another command on
       the same line (except a comment).

       The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase  readabil‐
       ity,  it can be written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of char‐
       acters terminated by the next tab, space, or  newline  character.   All
       characters  of  the  subcommand  word but the first are simply ignored.

   [1mObsolete command[0m
       In [4mclassical[24m [4mtroff[24m output, emitting a single glyph was mostly done by a
       very strange command that combined a horizontal move and  the  printing
       of  a  glyph.   It  didn’t have a command code, but is represented by a
       3‐character argument consisting of exactly 2 digits and a character.

       [4mddc[24m    Move right [4mdd[24m (exactly two decimal digits) basic units  [1mu[22m,  then
              print glyph with single‐letter name [4mc[24m.

              In  [4mgroff[24m,  arbitrary  [4msyntactical[24m  [4mspace[24m around and within this
              command is allowed to be added.  Only when a  preceding  command
              on the same line ends with an argument of variable length a sep‐
              arating space is obligatory.  In [4mclassical[24m [4mtroff[24m, large clusters
              of  these  and  other commands were used, mostly without spaces;
              this made such output almost unreadable.

       For modern high‐resolution devices, this command does  not  make  sense
       because the width of the glyphs can become much larger than two decimal
       digits.  In [4mgroff[24m, it is used only for output to the [1mX75[22m, [1mX75-12[22m, [1mX100[22m,
       and  [1mX100-12 [22mdevices.  For others, the commands [1mt [22mand [1mu [22mprovide greater
       functionality and superior troubleshooting capacity.

[1mPostprocessing[0m
       The [4mroff[24m postprocessors are programs that have the  task  to  translate
       the  [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m into actions that are sent to a device.  A de‐
       vice can be some piece of hardware such as a  printer,  or  a  software
       file  format suitable for graphical or text processing.  The [4mgroff[24m sys‐
       tem provides powerful means that make the  programming  of  such  post‐
       processors an easy task.

       There  is  a  library  function that parses the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m and
       sends the information obtained to the device via  methods  of  a  class
       with a common interface for each device.  So a [4mgroff[24m postprocessor must
       only redefine the methods of this class.  For details, see  the  refer‐
       ence in section “Files” below.

[1mExample[0m
       This  section  presents the [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m generated from the same

[1mCompatibility[0m
       The [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m language of the [4mclassical[24m [4mtroff[24m was first docu‐
       mented in [CSTR #97].  The [4mgroff[24m [4mintermediate[24m [4moutput[24m format is compati‐
       ble with this specification except for the following features.

       • The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.

       • The  old  hardware was very different from what we use today.  So the
         [4mgroff[24m devices are also fundamentally different from the ones in [4mclas‐[0m
         [4msical[24m [4mtroff[24m.  For example, the classical PostScript device was called
         [4mpost[24m and had a resolution of 720 units per inch, while [4mgroff[24m’s [4mps[24m de‐
         vice  has a resolution of 72000 units per inch.  Maybe, by implement‐
         ing some rescaling mechanism similar to the  classical  quasi  device
         independence, these could be integrated into modern [4mgroff[24m.

       • The B‐spline command [1mD~ [22mis correctly handled by the [4mintermediate[24m [4mout‐[0m
         [4mput[24m parser, but the drawing routines aren’t implemented  in  some  of
         the postprocessor programs.

       • The  argument  of the commands [1ms [22mand [1mx H [22mhas the implicit unit scaled
         point [1mz [22min [4mgroff[24m, while [4mclassical[24m [4mtroff[24m had point ([1mp[22m).  This isn’t an
         incompatibility,  but a compatible extension, for both units coincide
         for all devices without a [4msizescale[24m parameter, including all  classi‐
         cal  and  the  [4mgroff[24m  text  devices.   The  few  [4mgroff[24m devices with a
         sizescale parameter either did not exist, had a  different  name,  or
         seem to have had a different resolution.  So conflicts with classical
         devices are very unlikely.

       • The position changing after the commands [1mDp[22m, [1mDP[22m, and [1mDt [22mis illogical,
         but as old versions of groff used this feature it is kept for compat‐
         ibility reasons.

       The differences between [4mgroff[24m and [4mclassical[24m  [4mtroff[24m  are  documented  in

       groff_tmac - macro files in the GNU [4mroff[24m typesetting system

[1mDescription[0m
       Definitions of macros, strings, and registers for use in a [4mroff[24m(7) doc‐
       ument  can  be collected into [4mmacro[24m [4mfiles[24m, [4mroff[24m input files designed to
       produce no output themselves but instead ease the preparation of  other
       [4mroff[24m  documents.   There  is  no syntactical difference between a macro
       file and any other [4mroff[24m document; only its  purpose  distinguishes  it.
       When  a macro file is installed at a standard location, named according
       to a certain convention, and suitable for use by a general audience, it
       is  termed  a [4mmacro[24m [4mpackage[24m.  Macro packages can be loaded by supplying
       the [1m-m [22moption to [4mtroff[24m(1) or a [4mgroff[24m front end.

       Each macro package stores its macro, string, and  register  definitions
       in  one or more [4mtmac[24m files.  This name originated in early Unix culture
       as an abbreviation of “[4mtroff[24m macros”.

       A macro file must have a name in the form name[4m.tmac[24m (or [4mtmac.[24mname)  and
       be  placed in a “[4mtmac[24m directory” to be loadable with the [1m-m[4m[22mname[24m option.
       Section “Environment” of [4mtroff[24m(1) lists  these  directories.   Alterna‐
       tively,  a  [4mgroff[24m  document requiring a macro file can load it with the
       [1mmso [22m(“macro source”) request.

       Like any other [4mroff[24m document, a macro file can  use  the  “[1mso[22m”  request
       (“source”) to load further files relative to its own location.

       Macro  files  are  named  for  their most noteworthy application, but a
       macro file need not define any  macros.   It  can  restrict  itself  to
       defining  registers  and  strings or invoking other [4mgroff[24m requests.  It
       can even be empty.

[1mMacro packages[0m
       Macro packages come in two varieties; those which assume responsibility
       for  page  layout  and  other critical functions (“major” or “full‐ser‐
       vice”) and those which do not  (“supplemental”  or  “auxiliary”).   GNU
       [4mroff[24m provides most major macro packages found in AT&T and BSD Unix sys‐
       tems, an additional full‐service package, and many  supplemental  pack‐
       ages.   Multiple full‐service macro packages cannot be used by the same
       document.  Auxiliary packages can generally be freely combined,  though
       attention  to  their  use of the [4mgroff[24m language name spaces for identi‐
       fiers (particularly registers, macros, strings, and diversions)  should
       be  paid.   Name  space  management was a significant challenge in AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m; [4mgroff[24m’s support for arbitrarily long identifiers affords few ex‐
       cuses  for  name  collisions, apart from attempts at compatibility with
       the demands of historical documents.

   [1mMan pages[0m
       [4man[0m
       [4mman[24m    [4man[24m is used to compose man pages in  the  format  originating  in
              Version  7  Unix  (1979).  It has a small macro interface and is
              widely used; see [4mgroff_man[24m(7).

       [4mdoc[0m
       [4mmdoc[24m   [4mdoc[24m is used to compose man pages in the  format  originating  in
              4.3BSD‐Reno (1990).  It provides many more features than [4man[24m, but
              is also larger, more complex, and not  as  widely  adopted;  see
              [4mgroff_mdoc[24m(7).

       Because  readers of man pages often do not know in advance which macros
       are used to format a given document, a wrapper is available.

       [4mandoc[0m
       [4mmandoc[24m This macro file, specific to [4mgroff[24m, recognizes whether  a  docu‐
              ment  uses  [4mman[24m or [4mmdoc[24m format and loads the corresponding macro
              package.  Multiple man pages, in either format, can be  handled;
              [4mandoc[24m reloads each macro package as necessary.

   [1mFull‐service packages[0m
       The packages in this section provide a complete set of macros for writ‐
       ing documents of any kind, up to whole  books.   They  are  similar  in
       functionality; it is a matter of taste which one to use.

       [4mme[24m     The classical [4mme[24m macro package; see [4mgroff_me[24m(7).

       [4mmm[24m     The semi‐classical [4mmm[24m macro package; see [4mgroff_mm[24m(7).

       [4mmom[24m    The [4mmom[24m macro package, only available in groff.  As this was not
              based on other packages, it was freely designed as quite a nice,
              modern macro package.  See [4mgroff_mom[24m(7).

       [4mms[24m     The classical [4mms[24m macro package; see [4mgroff_ms[24m(7).

   [1mLocalization packages[0m
       For  Western languages, the localization file sets the hyphenation mode
       and loads hyphenation patterns and exceptions.  Localization files  can
       also adjust the date format and provide translations of strings used by
       some of the full‐service macro packages; alter the input encoding  (see
       the  next  section); and change the amount of additional inter‐sentence
       space.  For Eastern languages, the localization file defines  character
       classes  and  sets flags on them.  By default, [4mtroffrc[24m loads the local‐
       ization file for English.

       [4mtrans[24m  loads localized strings used by  various  macro  packages  after
              their localized forms have been prepared by a localization macro
              file.

       [4mgroff[24m provides the following localization files.

       [4mcs[24m     Czech; localizes [4mman[24m, [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m, [4mmom[24m, and [4mms[24m.  Sets the  input  en‐
              coding to Latin‐2 by loading [4mlatin2.tmac[24m.

       [4mde[0m
       [4mden[24m    German;  localizes [4mman[24m, [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m, [4mmom[24m, and [4mms[24m.  Sets the input en‐
              coding to Latin‐1 by loading [4mlatin1.tmac[24m.

              [4mde.tmac[24m selects hyphenation patterns for  traditional  orthogra‐
              phy, and [4mden.tmac[24m does the same for the new orthography (“Recht‐
              schreibreform”).

       [4men[24m     English.

       [4mfr[24m     French; localizes [4mman[24m, [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m, [4mmom[24m, and [4mms[24m.  Sets the input  en‐
              coding to Latin‐9 by loading [4mlatin9.tmac[24m.

       [4mit[24m     Italian; localizes [4mman[24m, [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m, [4mmom[24m, and [4mms[24m.

       [4mja[24m     Japanese.

       [4msv[24m     Swedish; localizes [4mman[24m, [4mme[24m, [4mmm[24m, [4mmom[24m, and [4mms[24m.  Sets the input en‐
              coding to Latin‐1 by loading [4mlatin1.tmac[24m.  Some of the localiza‐
              tion of the [4mmm[24m package is handled separately; see [4mgroff_mmse[24m(7).

       [4mzh[24m     Chinese.

   [1mInput encodings[0m
       [4mlatin1[0m
       [4mlatin2[0m
       [4mlatin5[0m
       [4mlatin9[24m are  various  ISO  8859  input encodings supported by [4mgroff[24m.  On
              systems using ISO character encodings, [4mgroff[24m  loads  [4mlatin1.tmac[0m
              automatically   at  startup.   A  document  that  uses  Latin‐2,
              Latin‐5, or Latin‐9 can specify one of these alternative  encod‐
              ings.

       [4mcp1047[24m provides  support for EBCDIC‐based systems.  On those platforms,
              [4mgroff[24m loads [4mcp1047.tmac[24m automatically at startup.

       Because different input character codes constitute valid GNU [4mtroff[24m  in‐
       put  on ISO and EBCDIC systems, the [4mlatin[24m macro files cannot be used on
       EBCDIC systems, and [4mcp1047[24m cannot be used on ISO systems.

   [1mAuxiliary packages[0m
       The macro packages in this section are  not  intended  for  stand‐alone
       use,  but  can add functionality to any other macro package or to plain
       (“raw”) [4mgroff[24m documents.

       [4m62bit[24m  provides macros for addition, multiplication,  and  division  of
              62‐bit  integers  (allowing safe multiplication of signed 31‐bit
              integers, for example).

       [4mhdtbl[24m  allows the generation of tables using a syntax  similar  to  the
              HTML  table model.  This Heidelberger table macro package is not
              a preprocessor, which can be useful if the contents of table en‐
              tries  are  determined  by macro calls or string interpolations.
              Compare to [4mtbl[24m(1).  It works only with the [1mps [22mand [1mpdf [22moutput de‐
              vices.  See [4mgroff_hdtbl[24m(7).

       [4mpapersize[0m
              enables the paper format to be set on the command line by giving
              a “[1m-d paper=[4m[22mformat[24m” option to [4mtroff[24m.  Possible values for [4mformat[0m
              are  the  ISO  and  DIN  formats  “[1mA0[22m–[1mA6[22m”, “[1mB0[22m–[1mB6[22m”, “[1mC0[22m–[1mC6[22m”, and
              “[1mD0[22m–[1mD6[22m”;  the  U.S.  formats   “[1mletter[22m”,   “[1mlegal[22m”,   “[1mtabloid[22m”,
              “[1mledger[22m”, “[1mstatement[22m”, and “[1mexecutive[22m”; and the envelope formats
              “[1mcom10[22m”, “[1mmonarch[22m”, and “[1mDL[22m”.  All formats, even those  for  en‐
              velopes,  are in portrait orientation: the length measurement is
              vertical.  Appending “l” (ell) to any of these denotes landscape
              orientation  instead.  This macro file assumes one‐inch horizon‐
              tal margins, and sets registers recognized  by  the  [4mgroff[24m  [4mman[24m,
              [4mmdoc[24m,  [4mmm[24m,  [4mmom[24m,  and [4mms[24m packages to configure them accordingly.
              If you want different margins, you will need to use those  pack‐
              ages’ facilities, or [4mtroff[24m [1mll [22mand/or [1mpo [22mrequests to adjust them.
              An output device typically requires command‐line options [1m-p  [22mand
              [1m-l  [22mto  override  the  paper dimensions and orientation, respec‐
              tively, defined in its [4mDESC[24m file; see subsection “Paper  format”
              of  [4mgroff[24m(1).   This macro file is normally loaded at startup by
              the [4mtroffrc[24m file when formatting for a typesetting  device  (but
              not a terminal).

       [4mpdfpic[24m provides  a  single macro, [1mPDFPIC[22m, to include a PDF graphic in a
              document using features of the [1mpdf  [22moutput  driver.   For  other
              output  devices, [1mPDFPIC [22mcalls [1mPSPIC[22m, with which it shares an in‐
              terface (see below).  This macro  file  is  normally  loaded  at
              startup by the [4mtroffrc[24m file.

       [4mpic[24m    supplies  definitions  of the macros [1mPS[22m, [1mPE[22m, and [1mPF[22m, usable with
              the [4mpic[24m(1) preprocessor.  They center each picture.  Use  it  if
              your document does not use a full‐service macro package, or that
              package does not supply working [4mpic[24m macro  definitions.   Except
              for  [4mman[24m  and [4mmdoc[24m, those provided with [4mgroff[24m already do so (ex‐
              ception: [4mmm[24m employs the name [1mPF [22mfor a different purpose).

       [4mpspic[24m  provides a macro, [1mPSPIC[22m, that includes a PostScript graphic in a
              document.   The  [1mps[22m, [1mdvi[22m, [1mhtml[22m, and [1mxhtml [22moutput devices support
              such inclusions; for all other drivers, the  image  is  replaced
              with  a  rectangular  border  of  the  same size.  [4mpspic.tmac[24m is
              loaded at startup by the [4mtroffrc[24m file.

              Its syntax is as follows.

                     [1m.PSPIC [22m[[1m-L[22m|[1m-R[22m|[1m-C[22m|[1m-I [4m[22mn[24m] [4mfile[24m [[4mwidth[24m [[4mheight[24m]]

              [4mfile[24m is the name of the PostScript file; [4mwidth[24m and  [4mheight[24m  give
              the  desired  width and height of the image.  If neither a [4mwidth[0m
              nor a [4mheight[24m argument is specified, the  image’s  natural  width
              (as given in the file’s bounding box) or the current line length
              is used as the width, whatever is smaller.  The [4mwidth[24m and [4mheight[0m
              arguments  may  have scaling units attached; the default scaling
              unit is [1mi[22m.  [1mPSPIC [22mscales the graphic uniformly in the horizontal
              and  vertical  directions  so that it is no more than [4mwidth[24m wide
              and [4mheight[24m high.  Option [1m-C [22mcenters  the  graphic  horizontally;
              this  is  the  default.   [1m-L  [22mand  [1m-R  [22mleft‐ and right‐align the
              graphic, respectively.  [1m-I [22mindents the graphic by [4mn[24m (with a  de‐
              fault scaling unit of [1mm[22m).

              To  use [1mPSPIC [22mwithin a diversion, we recommend extending it with
              the following code, assuring that  the  diversion’s  width  com‐
              pletely covers the image’s width.

                     .am PSPIC
                     .  vpt 0
                     \h'(\\n[ps-offset]u + \\n[ps-deswid]u)'
                     .  sp -1
                     .  vpt 1
                     ..

              Failure  to  load  [1mPSPIC[22m’s image argument is not an error.  (The
              [1mpsbb [22mrequest does issue an error diagnostic.)  To  make  such  a
              failure fatal, append to the [1mpspic*error-hook [22mmacro.

                     .am pspic*error-hook
                     .  ab
                     ..

       [4mptx[24m    provides  a  macro, [1mxx[22m, to format permuted index entries as pro‐
              duced by the GNU [4mptx[24m(1) program.  If your formatting needs  dif‐
              fer,  copy  the  macro  into  your document and adapt it to your
              needs.

       [4mrfc1345[0m
              defines special character escape sequences named for  the  glyph
              mnemonics specified in RFC 1345 and the digraph table of the Vim
              text editor.  See [4mgroff_rfc1345[24m(7).

       [4msboxes[24m offers an interface to the “[1mpdf: background[22m” device control com‐
              mand supported by [4mgropdf[24m(1).  Using this package, [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m docu‐
              ments can draw colored rectangles beneath any output.

              [1m.BOXSTART SHADED [4m[22mcolor[24m [1mOUTLINED [4m[22mcolor[24m [1mINDENT [4m[22msize[24m [1mWEIGHT [4m[22msize[0m
                     begins a box, where the argument after [1mSHADED  [22mgives  the
                     fill  color  and  that  after  [1mOUTLINED [22mthe border color.
                     Omit the former to get a borderless filled  box  and  the
                     latter  for  a border with no fill.  The specified [1mWEIGHT[0m
                     is used if the box is [1mOUTLINED[22m.

                     [1mINDENT [22mprecedes a value which leaves a  gap  between  the
                     border and the contents inside the box.

                     Each  [4mcolor[24m  must be a defined [4mgroff[24m color name, and each
                     [4msize[24m a valid [4mgroff[24m numeric expression.  The keyword/value
                     pairs can be specified in any order.

              Boxes can be stacked, so you can start a box within another box;
              usually the later boxes would be  smaller  than  the  containing
              box,  but  this  is not enforced.  When using [1mBOXSTART[22m, the left
              position is the current indent minus the [1mINDENT [22min the  command,
              and  the  right position is the left position (calculated above)
              plus the current line length and twice the indent.

              [1m.BOXSTOP[0m
                     takes no parameters.  It closes the most recently started
                     box  at  the  current  vertical position after adding its
                     [1mINDENT [22mspacing.

              Your [4mgroff[24m  documents  can  conditionally  exercise  the  [4msboxes[0m
              macros.  The register [1mGSBOX [22mis defined if the package is loaded,
              and interpolates a true value if the [1mpdf  [22moutput  device  is  in
              use.

              [4msboxes[24m furthermore hooks into the [4mgroff_ms[24m(7) package to receive
              notifications when footnotes are growing, so that it  can  close
              boxes  on a page before footnotes are printed.  When that condi‐
              tion obtains, [4msboxes[24m will close open boxes two points above  the
              footnote  separator  and  re‐open  them on the next page.  (This
              amount probably will not match the box’s [1mINDENT[22m.)

              See “Using PDF boxes with [4mgroff[24m and the [4mms[24m macros” for a  demon‐
              stration.

       [4mtrace[24m  aids  the  debugging  of [4mgroff[24m documents by tracing macro calls.
              See [4mgroff_trace[24m(7).

       [4mwww[24m    defines   macros   corresponding   to   HTML   elements.     See
              [4mgroff_www[24m(7).

[1mNaming[0m
       AT&T  [4mnroff[24m  and  [4mtroff[24m  were implemented before the conventions of the
       modern C [4mgetopt[24m(3) call evolved, and used a  naming  scheme  for  macro
       packages  that looks odd to modern eyes.  Macro packages were typically
       loaded using the [1m-m [22moption to the formatter; when directly followed  by
       its  argument without an intervening space, this looked like a long op‐
       tion preceded by a single minus—a sensation in the computer stone  age.
       Macro  packages  therefore  came to be known by names that started with
       the letter “m”, which was omitted from the name of the  macro  file  as
       stored  on  disk.  For example, the manuscript macro package was stored
       as [4mtmac.s[24m and loaded with the option [1m-ms[22m.

       [4mgroff[24m commands permit space between an option and  its  argument.   The
       syntax  “[1mgroff  -m s[22m” makes the macro file name more clear but may sur‐
       prise users familiar with the original  convention,  unaware  that  the
       package’s  “real”  name  was  “s” all along.  For such packages of long
       pedigree, [4mgroff[24m accommodates different users’ expectations by supplying
       wrapper  macro  files  that  load  the  desired file with [1mmso [22mrequests.
       Thus, all of “[1mgroff -m s[22m”, “[1mgroff -m ms[22m”, “[1mgroff -ms[22m”, and “[1mgroff -mms[22m”
       serve to load the manuscript macros.

       Wrappers  are  not  provided  for packages of more recent vintage, like
       [4mwww.tmac[24m.

       As noted in passing above, AT&T [4mtroff[24m named macro  files  in  the  form
       [4mtmac.[24mname.   It  has  since become conventional in operating systems to
       use a suffixed file name extension to suggest a file type or format.

[1mInclusion[0m
       The traditional method of employing a macro package is to  specify  the
       [1m-m  [4m[22mpackage[24m  option  to the formatter, which then reads [4mpackage[24m’s macro
       file prior to any input files.  Historically, [4mpackage[24m was sought  in  a
       file  named  [4mtmac.[24mpackage  (that is, with a “[1mtmac.[22m” prefix).  GNU [4mtroff[0m
       searches for package[4m.tmac[24m in the macro path; if not found, it looks for
       [4mtmac.[24mpackage instead, and vice versa.

       Alternatively, one could include a macro file by using the request “[1m.so[0m
       [4mfile‐name[24m” in the document; [4mfile‐name[24m is resolved relative to the loca‐
       tion  of  the  input document.  GNU [4mtroff[24m offers an improved feature in
       the similar request “[1mmso [4m[22mpackage‐file‐name[24m”, which searches  the  macro
       path  for  [4mpackage‐file‐name[24m.  Because its argument is a file name, its
       “[1m.tmac[22m” component must be included for the file to be  found;  however,
       as  a  convenience, if opening it fails, [1mmso [22mstrips any such suffix and
       tries again with a “[1mtmac.[22m” prefix, and vice versa.

       If a sourced file requires preprocessing, for example  if  it  includes
       [4mtbl[24m  tables  or [4meqn[24m equations, the preprocessor [4msoelim[24m(1) must be used.
       This can be achieved with a pipeline or, in [4mgroff[24m, by specifying the [1m-s[0m
       option to the formatter (or front end).  [4mman[24m(1) librarian programs gen‐
       erally call [4msoelim[24m automatically.  (Macro packages themselves generally
       do not require preprocessing.)

[1mWriting macros[0m
       A  [4mroff[24m(7)  document is a text file that is enriched by predefined for‐
       matting constructs, such as requests, escape  sequences,  strings,  nu‐
       meric  registers,  and macros from a macro package.  These elements are
       described in [4mroff[24m(7).

       To give a document a personal style, it is most useful  to  extend  the
       existing elements by defining some macros for repeating tasks; the best
       place for this is near the beginning of the document or in  a  separate
       file.

       Macros  without arguments are just like strings.  But the full power of
       macros occurs when arguments are passed with a macro call.  Within  the
       macro  definition,  the arguments are available as the escape sequences
       [1m\$1[22m, ..., [1m\$9[22m, [1m\$[[22m...[1m][22m, [1m\$*[22m, and [1m\$@[22m, the name under  which  the  macro
       was  called  is  in  [1m\$0[22m,  and  the  number of arguments is in register
       [1m\n[.$][22m; see [4mgroff[24m(7).

   [1mDraft mode[0m
       Writing groff macros is easy when the escaping mechanism is temporarily
       disabled.   In groff, this is done by enclosing the macro definition(s)
       within a pair of [1m.eo [22mand [1m.ec [22mrequests.  Then the body in the macro def‐
       inition  is  just like a normal part of the document — text enhanced by
       calls of requests, macros, strings, registers, etc.  For  example,  the
       code above can be written in a simpler way by

              .eo
              .ds midpart was called with the following
              .de print_args
              \f[I]\$0\f[] \*[midpart] \n[.$] arguments:
              \$*
              ..
              .ec

       Unfortunately,  draft  mode cannot be used universally.  Although it is
       good enough for defining normal macros, draft mode fails with  advanced
       applications,  such  as indirectly defined strings, registers, etc.  An
       optimal way is to define and test all macros in draft mode and then  do
       the backslash doubling as a final step; do not forget to remove the [4m.eo[0m
       request.

   [1mTips for macro definitions[0m
       •      Start every line with a dot, for example, by using the groff re‐
              quest  [1m.nop [22mfor text lines, or write your own macro that handles
              also text lines with a leading dot.

                     .de Text
                     .  if (\\n[.$] == 0) \
                     .    return
                     .  nop \)\\$*\)
                     ..

       •      Write a comment macro that works both for copy and draft  modes;
              since  the  escape character is off in draft mode, trouble might
              occur when comment escape sequences are used.  For example,  the
              following  macro  just  ignores its arguments, so it acts like a
              comment line:

                     .de c
                     ..
                     .c This is like a comment line.

       •      In long macro definitions, make ample use of  comment  lines  or
              almost‐empty  lines (this is, lines which have a leading dot and
              nothing else) for a better structuring.

       •      To increase readability, use groff’s  indentation  facility  for
              requests and macro calls (arbitrary whitespace after the leading
              dot).

   [1mDiversions[0m
       Diversions can be used to implement  quite  advanced  programming  con‐
       structs.   They  are comparable to pointers to large data structures in
       the C programming language, but their usage is quite different.

       In their simplest form, diversions are multi‐line strings,  but  diver‐
       sions  get  their power when used dynamically within macros.  The (for‐
       matted) information stored in a diversion can be retrieved  by  calling
       the diversion just like a macro.

       Most  of the problems arising with diversions can be avoided if you re‐
       member that diversions always store complete lines.   Using  diversions
       when the line buffer has not been flushed produces strange results; not
       knowing this, many people get desperate about  diversions.   To  ensure
       that  a  diversion  works,  add line breaks at the right places.  To be
       safe, enclose everything that has to do with diversions within  a  pair
       of  line  breaks;  for example, by explicitly using [1m.br [22mrequests.  This
       rule should be applied to diversion definition, both  inside  and  out‐
       side,  and  to all calls of diversions.  This is a bit of overkill, but
       it works nicely.

       (If you really need diversions which should ignore the current  partial
       line,  use environments to save the current partial line and/or use the
       [1m.box [22mrequest.)

       The most powerful feature using diversions  is  to  start  a  diversion
       within a macro definition and end it within another macro.  Then every‐
       thing between each call of this macro pair is stored within the  diver‐
       sion and can be manipulated from within the macros.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  is  short  for GNU [4mroff[24m, a free reimplementation of the AT&T de‐
       vice‐independent [4mtroff[24m typesetting system.  See [4mroff[24m(7) for a survey of
       and background on [4mroff[24m systems.

       This  document  is  intended as a reference.  The primary [4mgroff[24m manual,
       [4mGroff:[24m [4mThe[24m [4mGNU[24m [4mImplementation[24m [4mof[24m [4mtroff[24m, by Trent A. Fisher  and  Werner
       Lemberg,  is  a  better resource for learners, containing many examples
       and much discussion.  It is written in Texinfo; you can browse  it  in‐
       teractively  with  “info  groff”.   Additional formats, including plain
       text,  HTML,  DVI,  and  PDF,  may  be  available  in   [4m/usr/share/doc/[0m
       [4mgroff-1.23.0[24m.

       [4mgroff[24m  is also a name for an extended dialect of the [4mroff[24m language.  We
       use “roff” to denote features that are universal, or nearly  so,  among
       implementations  of this family.  We apply the term “groff” to the lan‐
       guage documented here, the GNU implementation of  the  overall  system,
       the project that develops that system, and the command of that name.

       GNU  [4mtroff[24m,  installed  on this system as [4mtroff[24m(1), is the [4mformatter:[24m a
       program that reads device and font descriptions ([4mgroff_font[24m(5)), inter‐
       prets  the [4mgroff[24m language expressed in text input files, and translates
       that input into a device‐independent output format ([4mgroff_out[24m(5))  that
       is  usually  then  post‐processed  by an output driver to produce Post‐
       Script, PDF, HTML, DVI, or terminal output.

[1mInput format[0m
       Input to GNU [4mtroff[24m is organized into lines separated by the  Unix  new‐
       line  character (U+000A), and must be in one of two character encodings
       it can recognize: IBM code page 1047 on EBCDIC systems, and ISO Latin‐1
       (8859‐1)  otherwise.   Use of ISO 646‐1991:IRV (“US‐ASCII”) or (equiva‐
       lently) the “Basic Latin” subset of ISO  10646  (“Unicode”)  is  recom‐
       mended;  see  [4mgroff_char[24m(7).   The  [4mpreconv[24m(1)  preprocessor transforms
       other encodings, including UTF‐8, to satisfy [4mtroff[24m’s requirements.

[1mSyntax characters[0m
       Several input characters are syntactically significant to [4mgroff[24m.

       .   A dot at the beginning of an input line marks it as a [4mcontrol[24m [4mline.[0m
           It  can also follow the [1m.el [22mand [1m.nop [22mrequests, and the condition in
           [1m.if[22m, [1m.ie[22m, and [1m.while [22mrequests.  The control character  invokes  re‐
           quests  and  calls macros by the name that follows it.  The [1m.cc [22mre‐
           quest can change the control character.

       '   The neutral apostrophe is the [4mno‐break[24m  [4mcontrol[24m  [4mcharacter,[24m  recog‐
           nized  where  the  control character is.  It suppresses the (first)
           break implied by the [1m.bp[22m, [1m.cf[22m, [1m.fi[22m, [1m.fl[22m, [1m.in[22m, [1m.nf[22m, [1m.rj[22m,  [1m.sp[22m,  [1m.ti[22m,
           and  [1m.trf  [22mrequests.   The  requested operation takes effect at the
           next break.  It makes [1m.br [22mnilpotent.  The no‐break control  charac‐
           ter  can  be changed with the [1m.c2 [22mrequest.  When formatted, “[1m'[22m” may
           be typeset as a typographical quotation mark; use the [1m\[aq] [22mspecial
           character escape sequence to format a neutral apostrophe glyph.

       "   The neutral double quote can be used to enclose arguments to macros
           and strings, and is required if those arguments  contain  space  or
           tab  characters.  In the [1m.ds[22m, [1m.ds1[22m, [1m.as[22m, and [1m.as1 [22mrequests, an ini‐
           tial neutral double quote in the second argument is stripped off to
           allow  embedding  of leading spaces.  To include a double quote in‐
           side a quoted argument, use the [1m\[dq] [22mspecial character escape  se‐
           quence (which also serves to typeset the glyph in text).

       \   A  backslash  introduces  an escape sequence.  The escape character
           can be changed with the [1m.ec [22mrequest; [1m.eo [22mdisables  escape  sequence
           recognition.   Use  the  [1m\[rs] [22mspecial character escape sequence to
           format a backslash glyph, and [1m\e [22mto typeset the glyph of  the  cur‐
           rent escape character.

       (   An opening parenthesis is special only in certain escape sequences;
           when recognized, it introduces an argument of exactly  two  charac‐
           ters.  [4mgroff[24m offers the more flexible square bracket syntax.

       [   An  opening  bracket  is  special only in certain escape sequences;
           when recognized, it introduces an argument (list)  of  any  length,
           not including a closing bracket.

       ]   A  closing bracket is special only when an escape sequence using an
           opening bracket as an argument delimiter is being interpreted.   It
           ends the argument (list).

       Additionally,  the  Control+A character (U+0001) in text is interpreted
       as a [4mleader[24m (see below).

       Horizontal white space characters are significant to [4mgroff,[24m but  trail‐
       ing spaces on text lines are ignored.

       [4mspace[24m   Space  characters  separate  arguments  in request invocations,
               macro calls, and string interpolations.  In text, they separate
               words.   Multiple adjacent space characters in text cause [4mgroff[0m
               to attempt end‐of‐sentence detection on the preceding word (and
               trailing  punctuation).   The amount of space between words and
               sentences is controlled by the [1m.ss [22mrequest.   When  filling  is
               enabled  (the  default), a line may be broken at a space.  When
               adjustment is enabled (the default), inter‐word spaces are  ex‐
               panded until the output line reaches the configured length.  An
               adjustable but non‐breaking space is available with [1m\~[22m.  To get
               a  space  of  fixed width, use one of the escape sequences ‘[1m\ [22m’
               (the escape character followed by a space), [1m\0[22m, [1m\|[22m, [1m\^[22m, or  [1m\h[22m;
               see section “Escape sequences” below.

       [4mnewline[24m In  text,  a  newline  puts an inter‐word space onto the output
               and, if filling is enabled, triggers  end‐of‐sentence  recogni‐
               tion  on  the  preceding text.  See section “Line continuation”
               below.

       [4mtab[24m     A tab character in text causes the drawing position to  advance
               to the next defined tab stop.

[1mTabs and leaders[0m
       The  formatter  interprets input horizontal tab characters (“tabs”) and
       Control+A characters (“leaders”) into movements to the next  tab  stop.
       Tabs  simply move to the next tab stop; leaders place enough periods to
       fill the space.  Tab stops are by default located every half inch  mea‐
       sured  from  the drawing position corresponding to the beginning of the
       input line; see section “Page geometry” of [4mroff[24m(7).  Tabs  and  leaders
       do  not cause breaks and therefore do not interrupt filling.  Tab stops
       can be configured with the [1mta [22mrequest, and tab and leader  glyphs  with
       the [1mtc [22mand [1mlc [22mrequests, respectively.

[1mLine continuation[0m
       When  filling is enabled, input and output line breaks generally do not
       correspond.  The [4mroff[24m language therefore distinguishes input and output
       line continuation.

       A backslash [1m\ [22mimmediately followed by a newline, sometimes discussed as
       [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m, suppresses the effects of that newline  on  the  input.   The
       next input line thus retains the classification of its predecessor as a
       control or text line.  [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m is useful for managing line lengths  in
       the  input  during document maintenance; you can break an input line in
       the middle of a request invocation, macro  call,  or  escape  sequence.
       Input  line continuation is invisible to the formatter, with two excep‐
       tions: the [1m| [22moperator recognizes the new input line, and the input line
       counter register [1m.c [22mis incremented.

       The  [1m\c [22mescape sequence continues an [4moutput[24m line.  Nothing on the input
       line after it is formatted.  In contrast to [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m, a line  after  [1m\c[0m
       is treated as a new input line, so a control character is recognized at
       its beginning.  The visual results depend on  whether  filling  is  en‐
       abled.   An  intervening control line that causes a break overrides [1m\c[22m,
       flushing out the pending output line in the usual  way.   The  register
       [1m.int  [22mcontains  a  positive value if the last output line was continued
       with [1m\c[22m; this datum is associated with the environment.

[1mColors[0m
       [4mgroff[24m supports color output with a variety of color spaces and up to 16
       bits  per  channel.   Some devices, particularly terminals, may be more
       limited.  When color support is enabled, two colors are current at  any
       given  time:  the  [4mstroke[24m  [4mcolor,[24m with which glyphs, rules (lines), and
       geometric objects like circles and polygons are  drawn,  and  the  [4mfill[0m
       [4mcolor,[24m  which  can  be used to paint the interior of a closed geometric
       figure.  The [1mcolor[22m, [1mdefcolor[22m, [1mgcolor[22m, and [1mfcolor [22mrequests;  [1m\m  [22mand  [1m\M[0m
       escape  sequences; and [1m.color[22m, [1m.m[22m, and [1m.M [22mregisters exercise color sup‐
       port.

       Each output device has a color named “[1mdefault[22m”, which cannot  be  rede‐
       fined.   A  device’s default stroke and fill colors are not necessarily
       the same.  For the [1mdvi[22m, [1mhtml[22m, [1mpdf[22m, [1mps[22m, and [1mxhtml [22moutput devices,  [4mtroff[0m
       automatically  loads a macro file defining many color names at startup.
       By the same mechanism, the devices supported by [4mgrotty[24m(1) recognize the
       eight  standard  ISO  6429/ECMA‐48  color names (also known vulgarly as
       “ANSI colors”).

[1mMeasurements[0m
       Numeric parameters that specify measurements are expressed as  integers
       or decimal fractions with an optional [4mscaling[24m [4munit[24m suffixed.  A scaling
       unit is a letter that immediately follows the last digit of  a  number.
       Digits after the decimal point are optional.

       Measurements are scaled by the scaling unit and stored internally (with
       any fractional part discarded) in basic units.  The  device  resolution
       can  therefore  be  obtained  by storing a value of “[1m1i[22m” to a register.
       The only constraint on the basic unit is that it is at least  as  small
       as any other unit.

       [1mu      [22mBasic unit.
       [1mi      [22mInch; defined as 2.54 centimeters.
       [1mc      [22mCentimeter.
       [1mp      [22mPoint;  a typesetter’s unit used for measuring type size.  There
              are 72 points to an inch.
       [1mP      [22mPica; another typesetter’s unit.  There are 6 picas to  an  inch
              and 12 points to a pica.
       [1ms[22m, [1mz   [22mScaled   points   and  multiplication  by  the  output  device’s
              [4msizescale[24m parameter, respectively.
       [1mf      [22mMultiplication by 65,536; scales decimal fractions in the inter‐
              val [0, 1] to 16‐bit unsigned integers.

       The magnitudes of other scaling units depend on the text formatting pa‐
       rameters in effect.

       [1mm      [22mEm; an em is equal to the current type size in points.
       [1mn      [22mEn; an en is one‐half em.
       [1mv      [22mVee; distance between text baselines.
       [1mM      [22mHundredth of an em.

   [1mMotion quanta[0m
       An output device’s basic unit [1mu [22mis not  necessarily  its  smallest  ad‐
       dressable  length;  [1mu  [22mcan  be  smaller  to avoid problems with integer
       roundoff.  The minimum distances that a device can  work  with  in  the
       horizontal and vertical directions are termed its [4mmotion[24m [4mquanta,[24m stored
       in the [1m.H [22mand [1m.V [22mregisters, respectively.  Measurements are rounded  to
       applicable motion quanta.  Half‐quantum fractions round toward zero.

   [1mDefault units[0m
       A general‐purpose register (one created or updated with the [1mnr [22mrequest;
       see section “Registers” below) is implicitly dimensionless, or reckoned
       in basic units if interpreted in a measurement context.  But it is con‐
       venient for many requests and escape sequences to infer a scaling  unit
       for  an  argument  if none is specified.  An explicit scaling unit (not
       after a closing parenthesis) can override an undesirable default.   Ef‐
       fectively,  the default unit is suffixed to the expression if a scaling
       unit is not already present.  GNU [4mtroff[24m’s  use  of  integer  arithmetic
       should also be kept in mind; see below.

       [4mtroff[24m provides a set of mathematical and logical operators familiar  to
       programmers—as  well  as  some  unusual  ones—but supports only integer
       arithmetic.  (Provision is made for interpreting and reporting  decimal
       fractions in certain cases.)  The internal data type used for computing
       results is usually a 32‐bit signed integer, which suffices to represent
       magnitudes  within  a  range of ±2 billion.  (If that’s not enough, see
       [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5) for the [4m62bit.tmac[24m macro package.)

       Arithmetic infix operators perform a function on  the  numeric  expres‐
       sions  to their left and right; they are [1m+ [22m(addition), [1m- [22m(subtraction),
       [1m* [22m(multiplication), [1m/ [22m(truncating division), and [1m% [22m(modulus).  [4mTruncat‐[0m
       [4ming[24m  [4mdivision[24m rounds to the integer nearer to zero, no matter how large
       the fractional portion.  Overflow and division (or modulus) by zero are
       errors and abort evaluation of a numeric expression.

       Arithmetic  unary  operators operate on the numeric expression to their
       right; they are [1m- [22m(negation) and [1m+ [22m(assertion—for completeness; it does
       nothing).  The unary minus must often be used with parentheses to avoid
       confusion with the decrementation operator, discussed below.

       The sign of the modulus of operands of mixed signs is determined by the
       sign  of the first.  Division and modulus operators satisfy the follow‐
       ing property: given a dividend [4ma[24m and a divisor [4mb[24m, a quotient  [4mq[24m  formed
       by “[1m(a / b)[22m” and a remainder [4mr[24m by “[1m(a % b)[22m”, then [4mqb[24m + [4mr[24m = [4ma[24m.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m’s scaling operator, used with parentheses as [1m([4m[22mc[24m[1m;[4m[22me[24m[1m)[22m, evaluates
       a numeric expression [4me[24m using [4mc[24m as the default scaling unit.   If  [4mc[24m  is
       omitted,  scaling  units are ignored in the evaluation of [4me[24m.  GNU [4mtroff[0m
       also provides a pair  of  operators  to  compute  the  extrema  of  two
       operands: [1m>? [22m(maximum) and [1m<? [22m(minimum).

       Comparison operators comprise [1m< [22m(less than), [1m> [22m(greater than), [1m<= [22m(less
       than or equal), [1m>= [22m(greater than or equal), and [1m=  [22m(equal).   [1m==  [22mis  a
       synonym for [1m=[22m.  When evaluated, a comparison is replaced with “[1m0[22m” if it
       is false and “[1m1[22m” if true.  In the [4mroff[24m language,  positive  values  are
       true, others false.

       We  can  operate  on truth values with the logical operators [1m& [22m(logical
       conjunction or “and”) and [1m: [22m(logical disjunction or “or”).  They evalu‐
       ate  as comparison operators do.  A logical complementation (“not”) op‐
       erator, [1m!, [22mworks only within “[1mif[22m”, “[1mie[22m”, and  “[1mwhile[22m”  requests.   Fur‐
       thermore, [1m! [22mis recognized only at the beginning of a numeric expression
       not contained by another numeric expression.  In other words,  it  must
       be  the “outermost” operator.  Including it elsewhere in the expression
       produces a warning in the “[1mnumber[22m” category (see [4mtroff[24m(1)), and its ex‐
       pression  evaluates  false.  This unfortunate limitation maintains com‐
       patibility with AT&T [4mtroff[24m.  Test a numeric expression for  falsity  by
       comparing it to a false value.

       The [4mroff[24m language has no operator precedence: expressions are evaluated
       strictly from left to right, in  contrast  to  schoolhouse  arithmetic.
       Use parentheses [1m( ) [22mto impose a desired precedence upon subexpressions.

       For  many  requests and escape sequences that cause motion on the page,
       the unary operators [1m+ [22mand [1m- [22mwork differently when leading a numeric ex‐
       pression.   They  then  indicate a motion relative to the drawing posi‐
       tion: positive is down in vertical contexts, right in horizontal ones.

       [1m+ [22mand [1m- [22mare also treated differently by the following requests and  es‐
       cape  sequences:  [1mbp[22m,  [1min[22m, [1mll[22m, [1mpl[22m, [1mpn[22m, [1mpo[22m, [1mps[22m, [1mpvs[22m, [1mrt[22m, [1mti[22m, [1m\H[22m, [1m\R[22m, and
       [1m\s[22m.  Here, leading plus and minus signs  serve  as  incrementation  and
       decrementation  operators, respectively.  To negate an expression, sub‐
       tract it from zero or include the unary minus in parentheses  with  its
       argument.

       A leading [1m| [22moperator indicates a motion relative not to the drawing po‐
       sition but to a boundary.   For  horizontal  motions,  the  measurement
       specifies  a  distance  relative to a drawing position corresponding to
       the beginning of the [4minput[24m line.  By default, tab  stops  reckon  move‐
       ments  in  this  way.  Most escape sequences do not; [1m| [22mtells them to do
       so.  For vertical motions, the [1m| [22moperator specifies a distance from the
       first  text baseline on the page or in the current diversion, using the
       current vertical spacing.

       The [1m\B [22mescape sequence tests its argument for validity as a numeric ex‐
       pression.

       A register interpolated as an operand in a numeric expression must have
       an Arabic format; luckily, this is the default.

       Due to the way arguments are parsed, spaces are not allowed in  numeric
       expressions unless the (sub)expression containing them is surrounded by
       parentheses.

[1mIdentifiers[0m
       An [4midentifier[24m labels a GNU [4mtroff[24m datum such as a register, name (macro,
       string,  or  diversion),  typeface, color, special character, character
       class, environment, or stream.  Valid identifiers  consist  of  one  or
       more  ordinary characters.  An [4mordinary[24m [4mcharacter[24m is an input character
       that is not the escape character, a leader, tab, newline, or invalid as
       GNU [4mtroff[24m input.

       Invalid  input  characters  are  subset of control characters (from the
       sets “C0 Controls” and “C1 Controls” as Unicode describes them).   When
       [4mtroff[24m  encounters  one in an identifier, it produces a warning in cate‐
       gory “[1minput[22m” (see section “Warnings” in [4mtroff[24m(1)).   They  are  removed
       during  interpretation:  an  identifier  “foo”,  followed by an invalid
       character and then “bar”, is processed as “foobar”.

       On a machine using the ISO 646, 8859, or 10646 character encodings, in‐
       valid  input characters are [1m0x00[22m, [1m0x08[22m, [1m0x0B[22m, [1m0x0D[22m–[1m0x1F[22m, and [1m0x80[22m–[1m0x9F[22m.
       On an EBCDIC host, they are [1m0x00[22m–[1m0x01[22m,  [1m0x08[22m,  [1m0x09[22m,  [1m0x0B[22m,  [1m0x0D[22m–[1m0x14[22m,
       [1m0x17[22m–[1m0x1F[22m,  and [1m0x30[22m–[1m0x3F[22m.  Some of these code points are used by [4mtroff[0m
       internally, making it non‐trivial to extend the program to accept UTF‐8
       or other encodings that use characters from these ranges.

       An  identifier  with  a  closing bracket (“]”) in its name can’t be ac‐
       cessed with bracket‐form escape sequences that expect an identifier  as
       a  parameter.   Similarly, the identifier “(” can’t be interpolated [4mex‐[0m
       [4mcept[24m with bracket forms.

       If you begin a macro, string, or diversion  name  with  either  of  the
       characters  “[” or “]”, you foreclose use of the [4mrefer[24m(1) preprocessor,
       which recognizes “.[” and “.]” as bibliographic reference delimiters.

       The escape sequence [1m\A [22mtests its argument for validity  as  an  identi‐
       fier.

       How GNU [4mtroff[24m handles the interpretation of an undefined identifier de‐
       pends on the context.  There is no way to invoke an undefined  request;
       such  syntax is interpreted as a macro call instead.  If the identifier
       is interpreted as a string, macro, or diversion, [4mtroff[24m emits a  warning
       in  category  “[1mmac[22m”, defines it as empty, and interpolates nothing.  If
       the identifier is interpreted as a register, [4mtroff[24m emits a  warning  in
       category  “[1mreg[22m”,  initializes  it to zero, and interpolates that value.
       See section “Warnings” in [4mtroff[24m(1), and subsection “Interpolating  reg‐
       isters”  and  section  “Strings” below.  Attempting to use an undefined
       typeface, style, special character, color,  character  class,  environ‐
       ment, or stream generally provokes an error diagnostic.

       Identifiers  for  requests,  macros,  strings, and diversions share one
       name space; special characters and character classes another.  No other
       object types do.

[1mControl characters[0m
       Control  characters  are  recognized  only at the beginning of an input
       line, or at the beginning of the branch of a control structure request;
       see section “Control structures” below.

       A few requests cause a break implicitly; use the no‐break control char‐
       acter to prevent the break.  Break suppression is its  sole  behavioral
       distinction.   Employing  the  no‐break control character to invoke re‐
       quests that don’t cause breaks is harmless but poor style.

       The control character “[1m.[22m” and the no‐break control character “[1m'[22m” can be
       changed with the [1mcc [22mand [1mc2 [22mrequests, respectively.  Within a macro def‐
       inition, register [1m.br [22mindicates the control character used to call it.

[1mInvoking requests[0m
       A control character is optionally followed by tabs  and/or  spaces  and
       then an identifier naming a request or macro.  The invocation of an un‐
       recognized request is interpreted as a macro call.   Defining  a  macro
       with  the  same name as a request replaces the request.  Deleting a re‐
       quest name with the [1mrm [22mrequest makes it unavailable.  The  [1mals  [22mrequest
       can  alias requests, permitting them to be wrapped or non‐destructively
       replaced.  See section “Strings” below.

       There is no inherent limit on argument length or  quantity.   Most  re‐
       quests  take  one or more arguments, and ignore any they do not expect.
       A request may be separated from its arguments by tabs  or  spaces,  but
       only  spaces can separate an argument from its successor.  Only one be‐
       tween arguments is necessary; any excess is ignored.   GNU  [4mtroff[24m  does
       not allow tabs for argument separation.

       Generally, a space [4mwithin[24m a request argument is not relevant, not mean‐
       ingful, or is supported by bespoke provisions, as with the [1mtl [22mrequest’s
       delimiters.   Some  requests,  like  [1mds[22m, interpret the remainder of the
       control line as a single argument.  See section “Strings” below.

       Spaces and tabs immediately after  a  control  character  are  ignored.
       Commonly, authors structure the source of documents or macro files with
       them.

[1mCalling macros[0m
       If a macro of the desired name does not exist when called, it  is  cre‐
       ated,  assigned an empty definition, and a warning in category “[1mmac[22m” is
       emitted.  Calling an undefined macro [4mdoes[24m end a macro definition naming
       it as its end macro (see section “Writing macros” below).

       To  embed  spaces [4mwithin[24m a macro argument, enclose the argument in neu‐
       tral double quotes ‘[1m"[22m’.  Horizontal motion escape sequences  are  some‐
       times a better choice for arguments to be formatted as text.

       The foregoing raises the question of how to embed neutral double quotes
       or backslashes in macro arguments when [4mthose[24m characters are desired  as
       literals.   In  GNU  [4mtroff[24m, the special character escape sequence [1m\[rs][0m
       produces a backslash and [1m\[dq] [22ma neutral double quote.

       In GNU [4mtroff[24m’s AT&T compatibility mode, these characters remain  avail‐
       able  as  [1m\(rs [22mand [1m\(dq[22m, respectively.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m did not consistently
       define these special characters, but its descendants  can  be  made  to
       support  them.   See  [4mgroff_font[24m(5).  If even that is not feasible, see
       the “Calling Macros” section of the [4mgroff[24m Texinfo manual for  the  com‐
       plex macro argument quoting rules of AT&T [4mtroff[24m.

[1mUsing escape sequences[0m
       Whereas  requests must occur on control lines, escape sequences can oc‐
       cur intermixed with text and  may  appear  in  arguments  to  requests,
       macros,  and  other escape sequences.  An escape sequence is introduced
       by the escape character, a backslash [1m\[22m.  The next character selects the
       escape’s function.

       Escape  sequences vary in length.  Some take an argument, and of those,
       some have different syntactical forms for a one‐character,  two‐charac‐
       ter,  or  arbitrary‐length  argument.  Others accept [4monly[24m an arbitrary‐
       length argument.  In the former scheme, a one‐character  argument  fol‐
       lows the function character immediately, an opening parenthesis “[1m([22m” in‐
       troduces a two‐character argument (no closing parenthesis is used), and
       an  argument  of arbitrary length is enclosed in brackets “[1m[][22m”.  In the
       latter scheme, the user selects a delimiter character.   A  few  escape
       sequences  are idiosyncratic, and support both of the foregoing conven‐
       tions ([1m\s[22m), designate their own termination sequence ([1m\?[22m), consume  in‐
       put until the next newline ([1m\![22m, [1m\"[22m, [1m\#[22m), or support an additional modi‐
       fier character ([1m\s [22magain, and [1m\n[22m).

       If an escape character is followed by a character that does  not  iden‐
       tify  a defined operation, the escape character is ignored (producing a
       diagnostic of the “[1mescape[22m” warning category, which is  not  enabled  by
       default) and the following character is processed normally.

       Escape  sequence  interpolation is of higher precedence than escape se‐
       quence argument interpretation.  This rule affords flexibility in using
       escape sequences to construct parameters to other escape sequences.

       The escape character can be interpolated ([1m\e[22m).  Requests permit the es‐
       cape mechanism to be deactivated ([1meo[22m) and restored, or the escape char‐
       acter changed ([1mec[22m), and to save and restore it ([1mecs [22mand [1mecr[22m).

[1mDelimiters[0m
       Some escape sequences that require parameters use delimiters.  The neu‐
       tral apostrophe [1m' [22mis a popular choice and shown in this document.   The
       neutral  double  quote [1m" [22mis also commonly seen.  Letters, numerals, and
       leaders can be used.  Punctuation characters are likely better choices,
       except for those defined as infix operators in numeric expressions; see
       below.

       The following escape sequences don’t take arguments and  thus  are  al‐
       lowed  as  delimiters:  [1m\[4m[22mspace[24m, [1m\%[22m, [1m\|[22m, [1m\^[22m, [1m\{[22m, [1m\}[22m, [1m\'[22m, [1m\`[22m, [1m\-[22m, [1m\_[22m, [1m\![22m,
       [1m\?[22m, [1m\)[22m, [1m\/[22m, [1m\,[22m, [1m\&[22m, [1m\:[22m, [1m\~[22m, [1m\0[22m, [1m\a[22m, [1m\c[22m, [1m\d[22m, [1m\e[22m, [1m\E[22m, [1m\p[22m, [1m\r[22m, [1m\t[22m, and [1m\u[22m.
       However,  using  them  this way is discouraged; they can make the input
       confusing to read.

       A few escape sequences, [1m\A[22m, [1m\b[22m, [1m\o[22m, [1m\w[22m, [1m\X[22m, and [1m\Z[22m, accept a newline as
       a  delimiter.   Newlines that serve as delimiters continue to be recog‐
       nized as input line terminators.  Use of newlines as delimiters in  es‐
       cape sequences is also discouraged.

       Finally,  the  escape sequences [1m\D[22m, [1m\h[22m, [1m\H[22m, [1m\l[22m, [1m\L[22m, [1m\N[22m, [1m\R[22m, [1m\s[22m, [1m\S[22m, [1m\v[22m,
       and [1m\x [22mprohibit many delimiters.

              • the numerals 0–9 and the decimal point “[1m.[22m”

              • the (single‐character) operators [1m+-/*%<>=&:()[0m

              • any escape sequences other than [1m\%[22m, [1m\:[22m, [1m\{[22m, [1m\}[22m,  [1m\'[22m,  [1m\`[22m,  [1m\-[22m,
                [1m\_[22m, [1m\![22m, [1m\/[22m, [1m\c[22m, [1m\e[22m, and [1m\p[0m

       Delimiter  syntax is complex and flexible primarily for historical rea‐
       sons; the foregoing restrictions need be kept in mind mainly when using
       [4mgroff[24m in AT&T compatibility mode.  GNU [4mtroff[24m keeps track of the nesting
       depth of escape sequence interpolations, so  the  only  characters  you
       need  to  avoid  using as delimiters are those that appear in the argu‐
       ments you input, not any that result from interpolation.  Typically,  [1m'[0m
       works fine.  See section “Implementation differences” in [4mgroff_diff[24m(7).

[1mDummy characters[0m
       As  discussed  in  [4mroff[24m(7),  the  first  character  on an input line is
       treated specially.  Further, formatting a glyph has  many  consequences
       on  formatter  state (see section “Environments” below).  Occasionally,
       we want to escape this context or embrace some  of  those  consequences
       without  actually  rendering  a glyph to the output.  [1m\& [22minterpolates a
       dummy character, which is constitutive of output  but  invisible.   Its
       presence  alters the interpretation context of a subsequent input char‐
       acter, and enjoys several applications: preventing the insertion of ex‐
       tra space after an end‐of‐sentence character, preventing interpretation
       of a control character at the beginning of an  input  line,  preventing
       kerning  between  two  glyphs, and permitting the [1mtr [22mrequest to remap a
       character to “nothing”.  [1m\) [22mworks as [1m\& [22mdoes, except that it  does  not
       cancel a pending end‐of‐sentence state.

[1mControl structures[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  has  “if”  and  “while” control structures like other languages.
       However, the syntax for grouping multiple input lines in  the  branches
       or bodies of these structures is unusual.

       They  have  a  common form: the request name is (except for [1m.el [22m“else”)
       followed by a conditional expression [4mcond‐expr[24m; the  remainder  of  the
       line,  [4manything[24m, is interpreted as if it were an input line.  Any quan‐
       tity of spaces between arguments to requests serves  only  to  separate
       them;  leading spaces in [4manything[24m are therefore not seen.  [4manything[24m ef‐
       fectively [4mcannot[24m be omitted; if  [4mcond‐expr[24m  is  true  and  [4manything[24m  is
       empty,  the  newline at the end of the control line is interpreted as a
       blank line (and therefore a blank text line).

       It is frequently desirable for a control structure to govern more  than
       one  request, macro call, or text line, or a combination of the forego‐
       ing.  The opening and closing brace escape sequences [1m\{ [22mand [1m\}  [22mperform
       such  grouping.   Brace  escape sequences outside of control structures
       have no meaning and produce no output.

       [1m\{ [22mshould appear (after optional spaces and  tabs)  immediately  subse‐
       quent  to  the request’s conditional expression.  [1m\} [22mshould appear on a
       line with other occurrences of itself as  necessary  to  match  [1m\{  [22mse‐
       quences.   It can be preceded by a control character, spaces, and tabs.
       Input after any quantity of [1m\} [22msequences on the same line is  processed
       only if all the preceding conditions to which they correspond are true.
       Furthermore, a [1m\} [22mclosing the body of a [1m.while [22mrequest must be the last
       such escape sequence on an input line.

   [1mConditional expressions[0m
       The  [1m.if[22m, [1m.ie[22m, and [1m.while [22mrequests test the truth values of numeric ex‐
       pressions.  They also support several additional Boolean operators; the
       members  of  this  expanded  class  are termed [4mconditional[24m [4mexpressions[24m;
       their truth values are as shown below.

                [1mr [4m[22mn[24m   a register named [4mn[24m is defined.
                [1mS [4m[22ms[24m   a font style named [4ms[24m is available.
                  [1mt   [22mthe formatter is in [4mtroff[24m mode.

       If the first argument to an [1m.if[22m, [1m.ie[22m, or [1m.while [22mrequest begins  with  a
       non‐alphanumeric  character  apart  from  [1m! [22m(see below); it performs an
       [4moutput[24m [4mcomparison[24m [4mtest.[24m  Shown first in the  table  above,  the  [4moutput[0m
       [4mcomparison[24m  [4moperator[24m  interpolates  a true value if formatting its com‐
       parands [4ms1[24m and [4ms2[24m produces the same output commands.  Other  delimiters
       can  be used in place of the neutral apostrophes.  [4mtroff[24m formats [4ms1[24m and
       [4ms2[24m in separate environments; after the comparison, the  resulting  data
       are  discarded.  The resulting glyph properties, including font family,
       style, size, and slant, must match, but not  necessarily  the  requests
       and/or  escape  sequences  used  to obtain them.  Motions must match in
       orientation and magnitude to within the applicable horizontal or verti‐
       cal motion quantum of the device, after rounding.

       Surround  the  comparands with [1m\? [22mto avoid formatting them; this causes
       them to be compared character by character, as with string  comparisons
       in other programming languages.  Since comparands protected with [1m\? [22mare
       read in copy mode, they need not even be valid [4mgroff[24m syntax.   The  es‐
       cape character is still lexically recognized, however, and consumes the
       next character.

       The above operators can’t be combined with most others, but  a  leading
       “[1m![22m”, not followed immediately by spaces or tabs, complements an expres‐
       sion.  Spaces and tabs are optional immediately  after  the  “[1mc[22m”,  “[1md[22m”,
       “[1mF[22m”,  “[1mm[22m”,  “[1mr[22m”,  and  “[1mS[22m” operators, but right after “[1m![22m”, they end the
       predicate and the conditional evaluates true.  (This  bizarre  behavior
       maintains compatibility with AT&T [4mtroff[24m.)

[1mSyntax reference conventions[0m
       In the following request and escape sequence specifications, most argu‐
       ment names were chosen to be descriptive.  A few  denotations  may  re‐
       quire introduction.

              [4mc[24m         denotes a single input character.
              [4mfont[24m      a  font  either  specified as a font name or a numeric
                        mounting position.
              [4manything[24m  all characters up to the end of the line, to the  end‐
                        ing  delimiter  for  the escape sequence, or within [1m\{[0m
                        and [1m\}[22m.  Escape sequences may generally be used freely
                        in [4manything[24m, except when it is read in copy mode.
              [4mmessage[24m   is  a character sequence to be emitted on the standard
                        error stream.  Special character escape sequences  are
                        [4mnot[24m interpreted.
              [4mn[24m         is  a numeric expression that evaluates to a non‐nega‐
                        tive integer.
              [4mnpl[24m       is a numeric expression constituting a count of subse‐
                        quent  [4mproductive[24m input lines; that is, those that di‐
                        rectly produce formatted output.  Text  lines  produce
                        output,  as  do control lines containing requests like
                        [1m.tl [22mor escape sequences like [1m\D[22m.  Macro calls are  not
                        themselves productive, but their interpolated contents
                        can be.
              [4m±N[24m        is a numeric expression with a  meaning  dependent  on
                        its sign.

       If  a numeric expression presented as [4m±N[24m starts with a ‘[1m+[22m’ sign, an in‐
       crement in the amount of of [4mN[24m is applied to the value applicable to the
       request  or escape sequence.  If it starts with a ‘[1m-[22m’ sign, a decrement
       of magnitude [4mN[24m is applied instead.  Without a sign, [4mN[24m replaces any  ex‐
       isting  value.   A  leading  minus sign in [4mN[24m is always interpreted as a
       decrementation operator, not an algebraic sign.  To assign a register a
       negative  value  or  the  negated value of another register, enclose it
       with its operand in parentheses or subtract it from zero.  If  a  prior
       value  does  not  exist  (the  register was undefined), an increment or
       decrement is applied as if to 0.

                 Define a color named [4mident.[24m  [4mscheme[24m identifies a color  space
                 and  determines  the  number of required [4mcolor‐component[24ms; it
                 must be one  of  “[1mrgb[22m”  (three  components),  “[1mcmy[22m”  (three),
                 “[1mcmyk[22m” (four), or “[1mgray[22m” (one).  “[1mgrey[22m” is accepted as a syn‐
                 onym of “[1mgray[22m”.  The color components can  be  encoded  as  a
                 single  hexadecimal  value starting with [1m# [22mor [1m##[22m.  The former
                 indicates that each component is in the range  0–255  (0–FF),
                 the  latter the range 0–65,535 (0–FFFF).  Alternatively, each
                 color component can be specified as a decimal fraction in the
                 range  0–1,  interpreted using a default scaling unit of “[1mf[22m”,
                 which multiplies its  value  by  65,536  (but  clamps  it  at
                 65,535).   Each  output  device  has a color named “[1mdefault[22m”,
                 which cannot be redefined.  A  device’s  default  stroke  and
                 fill colors are not necessarily the same.

   [1mDrawing commands[0m
       Drawing commands direct the output device to render geometrical objects
       rather than glyphs.  Specific devices may support only a subset, or may
       feature additional ones; consult the man page for the output driver  in
       use.  Terminal devices in particular implement almost none.

       Rendering  starts  at  the drawing position; when finished, the drawing
       position is left at the rightmost point of the object, even for  closed
       figures,  except  where  noted.  GNU [4mtroff[24m draws stroked (outlined) ob‐
       jects with the stroke color, and  shades  filled  ones  with  the  fill
       color.  See section “Colors” above.  Coordinates [4mh[24m and [4mv[24m are horizontal
       and vertical motions relative to the drawing position or previous point
       in  the  command.  The default scaling unit for horizontal measurements
       (and diameters of circles) is [1mm[22m; for vertical ones, [1mv[22m.

       Circles, ellipses, and polygons can be drawn stroked or filled.   These
       are  independent  properties; if you want a filled, stroked figure, you
       must draw the same figure twice using each drawing command.   A  filled
       figure  is  always  smaller  than an outlined one because the former is
       drawn only within its defined area, whereas strokes have a line  thick‐
       ness (set with [1m\D't'[22m).

   [1mDevice control commands[0m
       The  [1m.device [22mand [1m.devicem [22mrequests, and [1m\X [22mand [1m\Y [22mescape sequences, en‐
       able documents to pass information directly to a postprocessor.   These
       are  useful  for exercising device‐specific capabilities that the [4mgroff[0m
       language does not abstract or generalize; such  functions  include  the
       embedding of hyperlinks and image files.  Device‐specific functions are
       documented in each output driver’s man page.

[1mStrings[0m
       [4mgroff[24m supports strings primarily for user convenience.  Conventionally,
       if one would define a macro only to interpolate a small amount of text,
       without invoking requests or calling any other macros,  one  defines  a
       string instead.  Only one string is predefined by the language.

       \*[[1m.T[22m]    Contains  the  name of the output device (for example, “[1mutf8[22m”
                 or “[1mpdf[22m”[1m).[0m

       The [1m.ds [22mrequest creates a string with a specified  name  and  contents.
       If  the  identifier named by [1m.ds [22malready exists as an alias, the target
       of the alias is redefined.  If [1m.ds [22mis called with  only  one  argument,
       the  named string becomes empty.  Otherwise, [4mtroff[24m stores the remainder
       of the control line in copy mode; see subsection “Copy mode” below.

       The [1m\* [22mescape sequence dereferences a string’s name, interpolating  its
       contents.   If the name does not exist, it is defined as empty, nothing
       is interpolated, and a warning in category “[1mmac[22m” is emitted.  See  sec‐
       tion  “Warnings” in [4mtroff[24m(1).  The bracketed interpolation form accepts
       arguments that are handled as macro arguments are; see section “Calling
       macros”  above.   In  contrast  to  macro  calls, however, if a closing
       bracket [1m] [22moccurs in a string argument, that argument must  be  enclosed
       in  double quotes.  [1m\* [22mis interpreted even in copy mode.  When defining
       strings, argument interpolations must be escaped if they are to  refer‐
       ence  parameters from the calling context; see section “Parameters” be‐
       low.

       An initial neutral double quote [1m" [22min the string contents is stripped to
       allow  embedding  of leading spaces.  Any other [1m" [22mis interpreted liter‐
       ally, but it is wise to use the special character escape sequence [1m\[dq][0m
       instead  if  the  string might be interpolated as part of a macro argu‐
       ment; see section “Calling macros” above.  Strings are not limited to a
       single  input  line of text.  [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m works just as it does elsewhere.
       The resulting string is stored [4mwithout[24m the newlines.  Care is therefore
       required  when  interpolating strings while filling is disabled.  It is
       not possible to embed a newline in a string that will be interpreted as
       such  when  the string is interpolated.  To achieve that effect, use [1m\*[0m
       to interpolate a macro instead.

       The [1m.as [22mrequest is similar to [1m.ds [22mbut appends to a  string  instead  of
       redefining  it.   If [1m.as [22mis called with only one argument, no operation
       is performed (beyond dereferencing the string).

       Because strings are similar to macros, they too can be defined to  sup‐
       press  AT&T  [4mtroff[24m compatibility mode enablement when interpolated; see
       section “Compatibility mode” below.  The [1m.ds1 [22mrequest defines a  string
       that suspends compatibility mode when the string is later interpolated.
       [1m.as1 [22mis likewise similar to [1m.as[22m, with compatibility mode suspended when
       the appended portion of the string is later interpolated.

       [1mCaution:  [22mUnlike  other requests, the second argument to these requests
       consumes the remainder of the input line,  including  trailing  spaces.
       Ending  string  definitions  (and  appendments) with a comment, even an
       empty one, prevents unwanted  space  from  creeping  into  them  during
       source document maintenance.

       Several  requests  exist  to  perform  rudimentary  string  operations.
       Strings can be  queried  ([1m.length[22m)  and  modified  ([1m.chop[22m,  [1m.substring[22m,
       [1m.stringup[22m, [1m.stringdown[22m), and their names can be manipulated through re‐
       naming, removal, and aliasing ([1m.rn[22m, [1m.rm[22m, [1m.als).[0m

       When a request, macro, string, or diversion is  aliased,  redefinitions
       and  appendments “write through” alias names.  To replace an alias with
       a separately defined object, you must use the [1mrm [22mrequest  on  its  name
       first.

[1mRegisters[0m
       In  the [4mroff[24m language, numbers can be stored in [4mregisters.[24m  Many built‐
       in registers exist, supplying anything from the date to details of for‐
       matting  parameters.  You can also define your own.  See section “Iden‐
       tifiers” above for information on constructing a valid name for a  reg‐
       ister.

       Define  registers and update their values with the [1mnr [22mrequest or the [1m\R[0m
       escape sequence.

       Registers can also be incremented or decremented by a configured amount
       at the time they are interpolated.  The value of the increment is spec‐
       ified with a third argument to the [1m.nr [22mrequest, and a special  interpo‐
       lation  syntax,  [1m\n[4m[22m±[24m  is used to alter and then retrieve the register’s
       value.  Together, these features are called [4mauto‐increment[24m.   (A  nega‐
       tive auto‐increment can be considered an “auto‐decrement”.)

       Many  predefined  registers  are available.  In the following presenta‐
       tion, the register interpolation syntax [1m\n[[4m[22mname[24m[1m] [22mis used to refer to  a
       register  [4mname[24m to clearly distinguish it from a string or request [4mname[24m.
       The register name space  is  separate  from  that  used  for  requests,
       macros,  strings,  and  diversions.  Bear in mind that the symbols [1m\n[][0m
       are [4mnot[24m part of the register name.

   [1mRead‐only registers[0m
       Predefined registers whose identifiers start with a dot are  read‐only.
       Many are Boolean‐valued.  Some are string‐valued, meaning that they in‐
       terpolate text.  A register name (without the dot) is often  associated
       with a request of the same name; exceptions are noted.

[1mUsing fonts[0m
       In digital typography, a [4mfont[24m is a collection of characters in  a  spe‐
       cific  typeface  that  a device can render as glyphs at a desired size.
       (Terminals and some output devices have fonts that render at  only  one
       or  two  sizes.  As examples of the latter, take the [4mgroff[24m [1mlj4 [22mdevice’s
       Lineprinter, and [1mlbp[22m’s Courier and Elite faces.)  A [4mroff[24m formatter  can
       change  typefaces  at any point in the text.  The basic faces are a set
       of [4mstyles[24m combining upright and slanted shapes with  normal  and  heavy
       stroke  weights:  “[1mR[22m”,  “[1mI[22m”, “[1mB[22m”, and “[1mBI[22m”—these stand for [4mroman,[24m [4mbold,[0m
       [4mitalic,[24m and [4mbold‐italic.[24m  For linguistic text, GNU [4mtroff[24m  groups  type‐
       faces  into  [4mfamilies[24m containing each of these styles.  (Font designers
       prepare families such that the styles share  esthetic  properties.)   A
       [4mtext[24m [4mfont[24m is thus often a family combined with a style, but it need not
       be: consider the  [1mps  [22mand  [1mpdf  [22mdevices’  [1mZCMI  [22m(Zapf  Chancery  Medium
       italic)—often,  no other style of Zapf Chancery Medium is provided.  On
       typesetting devices, at least one [4mspecial[24m [4mfont[24m is available, comprising
       [4munstyled[24m glyphs for mathematical operators and other purposes.

       Like AT&T [4mtroff,[24m GNU [4mtroff[24m does not itself load or manipulate a digital
       font file; instead it works with a [4mfont[24m [4mdescription[24m [4mfile[24m  that  charac‐
       terizes it, including its glyph repertoire and the [4mmetrics[24m (dimensions)
       of each glyph.  This information permits the  formatter  to  accurately
       place  glyphs with respect to each other.  Before using a font descrip‐
       tion, the formatter associates it with a [4mmounting[24m [4mposition,[24m a place  in
       an ordered list of available typefaces.  So that a document need not be
       strongly coupled to a specific font family, in GNU [4mtroff[24m an output  de‐
       vice  can associate a style in the abstract sense with a mounting posi‐
       tion.  Thus the default family can be combined  with  a  style  dynami‐
       cally, producing a [4mresolved[24m [4mfont[24m [4mname.[0m

       Fonts  often  have  trademarked names, and even Free Software fonts can
       require renaming upon modification.  [4mgroff[24m maintains a convention  that
       a  device’s  serif font family is given the name [1mT [22m(“Times”), its sans‐
       serif family [1mH [22m(“Helvetica”), and its monospaced family [1mC  [22m(“Courier”).
       Historical  inertia has driven [4mgroff[24m’s font identifiers to short upper‐
       case abbreviations of font names, as with [1mTR[22m, [1mTB[22m, [1mTI[22m, [1mTBI[22m, and  a  spe‐
       cial font [1mS[22m.

       The  default  family  used  with  abstract styles can be changed at any
       time; initially, it is [1mT[22m.  Typically, abstract styles are  arranged  in
       the  first  four  mounting positions in the order shown above.  The de‐
       fault mounting position, and therefore style, is always [1m1 [22m([1mR[22m).  By  is‐
       suing  appropriate  formatter  instructions, you can override these de‐
       faults before your document writes its first glyph.

       Terminal output devices cannot change font families  and  lack  special
       fonts.   They  support  style  changes  by overstriking, or by altering
       ISO 6429/ECMA‐48 [4mgraphic[24m [4mrenditions[24m (character cell attributes).

[1mHyphenation[0m
       When filling, [4mgroff[24m hyphenates words as needed  at  user‐specified  and
       automatically  determined  hyphenation  points.   Explicitly hyphenated
       words such as “mother‐in‐law” are always eligible  for  breaking  after
       each  of  their hyphens.  The hyphenation character [1m\% [22mand non‐printing
       break point [1m\: [22mescape sequences may be used to control the  hyphenation
       and  breaking  of  individual words.  The [1m.hw [22mrequest sets user‐defined
       hyphenation points for specified words at  any  subsequent  occurrence.
       Otherwise,  [4mgroff[24m  determines  hyphenation  points automatically by de‐
       fault.

       Several requests influence automatic hyphenation.  Because  conventions
       vary,  a  variety of hyphenation modes is available to the [1m.hy [22mrequest;
       these determine whether hyphenation will  apply  to  a  word  prior  to
       breaking  a  line at the end of a page (more or less; see below for de‐
       tails), and at which positions within that  word  automatically  deter‐
       mined  hyphenation points are permissible.  The default is “[1m1[22m” for his‐
       torical reasons, but this is not an appropriate value for  the  English
       hyphenation  patterns used by [4mgroff[24m; localization macro files loaded by
       [4mtroffrc[24m and macro packages often override it.

       [1m0      [22mdisables hyphenation.

       [1m1      [22menables hyphenation except after the first and before  the  last
              character of a word.

       The  remaining values “imply” [1m1[22m; that is, they enable hyphenation under
       the same conditions as “[1m.hy 1[22m”, and then  apply  or  lift  restrictions
       relative to that basis.

       [1m2      [22mdisables  hyphenation  of the last word on a page.  (Hyphenation
              is prevented if the next page location trap  is  closer  to  the
              vertical  drawing position than the next text baseline would be.
              See section “Traps” below.)

       [1m4      [22mdisables hyphenation before the last two characters of a word.

       [1m8      [22mdisables hyphenation after the first two characters of a word.

       [1m16     [22menables hyphenation before the last character of a word.

       [1m32     [22menables hyphenation after the first character of a word.

       Apart from value 2, restrictions imposed by the  hyphenation  mode  are
       [4mnot[24m respected for words whose hyphenations have been specified with the
       hyphenation character (“[1m\%[22m” by default) or the [1m.hw [22mrequest.

       Nonzero values are additive.  For example, mode 12 causes [4mgroff[24m to  hy‐
       phenate  neither  the  last two nor the first two characters of a word.
       Some values cannot be used together because they  contradict;  for  in‐
       stance,  values  4 and 16, and values 8 and 32.  As noted, it is super‐
       fluous to add 1 to any non‐zero even mode.

       The places within a word that are eligible for hyphenation  are  deter‐
       mined  by language‐specific data ([1m.hla[22m, [1m.hpf[22m, and [1m.hpfa[22m) and lettercase
       relationships ([1m.hcode [22mand [1m.hpfcode[22m).   Furthermore,  hyphenation  of  a
       word might be suppressed due to a limit on consecutive hyphenated lines
       ([1m.hlm[22m), a minimum line length threshold ([1m.hym[22m), or because the line can
       instead be adjusted with additional inter‐word space ([1m.hys[22m).

[1mLocalization[0m
       The set of hyphenation patterns is associated with the hyphenation lan‐
       guage set by the [1m.hla [22mrequest.  The [1m.hpf [22mrequest is usually invoked  by
       a  localization file loaded by the [4mtroffrc[24m file.  [4mgroff[24m provides local‐
       ization files for several languages; see [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5).

[1mWriting macros[0m
       The [1m.de [22mrequest defines a macro named for its argument.  If  that  name
       already  exists  as an alias, the target of the alias is redefined; see
       section “Strings” above.  [4mtroff[24m enters “copy mode” (see below), storing
       subsequent input lines as the definition.  If the optional second argu‐
       ment is not specified, the definition ends with the control  line  “[1m..[22m”
       (two  dots).  Alternatively, a second argument names a macro whose call
       syntax ends the definition; this “end macro” is then  called  normally.
       Spaces  or  tabs are permitted after the first control character in the
       line containing this ending token, but a tab immediately after the  to‐
       ken  prevents  its recognition as the end of a macro definition.  Macro
       definitions can be nested if they use distinct end macros or  if  their
       ending  tokens  are sufficiently escaped.  An end macro need not be de‐
       fined until it is called.  This fact enables a nested macro  definition
       to begin inside one macro and end inside another.

       Variants of [1m.de [22mdisable compatibility mode and/or indirect the names of
       the macros specified for definition or  termination:  these  are  [1m.de1[22m,
       [1m.dei[22m, and [1m.dei1[22m.  Append to macro definitions with [1m.am[22m, [1m.am1[22m, [1m.ami[22m, and
       [1m.ami1[22m.  The [1m.als[22m, [1m.rm[22m, and [1m.rn [22mrequests create an alias of, remove, and
       rename  a  macro, respectively.  [1m.return [22mstops the execution of a macro
       immediately, returning to the enclosing context.

   [1mParameters[0m
       Macro call and string interpolation parameters can  be  accessed  using
       escape  sequences  starting  with  “[1m\$[22m”.  The [1m\n[.$] [22mread‐only register
       stores the count of parameters available to  a  macro  or  string;  its
       value  can  be changed by the [1m.shift [22mrequest, which dequeues parameters
       from the current list.  The [1m\$0 [22mescape sequence interpolates  the  name
       by  which a macro was called.  Applying string interpolation to a macro
       does not change this name.

   [1mCopy mode[0m
       When [4mtroff[24m processes certain requests, most importantly those which de‐
       fine or append to a macro or string, it does so in [4mcopy[24m [4mmode[24m: it copies
       the characters of the definition into a dedicated storage  region,  in‐
       terpolating  the  escape sequences [1m\n[22m, [1m\g[22m, [1m\$[22m, [1m\*[22m, [1m\V[22m, and [1m\? [22mnormally;
       interpreting [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m immediately; discarding comments [1m\" [22mand  [1m\#[22m;  in‐
       terpolating  the  current leader, escape, or tab character with [1m\a[22m, [1m\e[22m,
       and [1m\t[22m, respectively; and storing all other escape sequences in an  en‐
       coded  form.   The  complement of copy mode—a [4mroff[24m formatter’s behavior
       when not defining or appending to a macro, string,  or  diversion—where
       all  macros  are  interpolated,  requests invoked, and valid escape se‐
       quences processed immediately upon recognition, can be termed [4minterpre‐[0m
       [4mtation[24m [4mmode[24m.

       The  escape  character,  [1m\ [22mby default, can escape itself.  This enables
       you to control whether a given [1m\n[22m, [1m\g[22m, [1m\$[22m, [1m\*[22m, [1m\V[22m,  or  [1m\?  [22mescape  se‐
       quence  is  interpreted at the time the macro containing it is defined,
       or later when the macro is called.

       You can think of [1m\\ [22mas a “delayed” backslash; it is the escape  charac‐
       ter followed by a backslash from which the escape character has removed
       its special meaning.  Consequently, [1m\\ [22mis not an escape sequence in the
       usual  sense.  In any escape sequence [1m\[4m[22mX[24m that [4mtroff[24m does not recognize,
       the escape character is ignored and [4mX[24m is output.  An  unrecognized  es‐
       cape  sequence  causes  a warning in category “[1mescape[22m”, with two excep‐
       tions, [1m\\ [22mbeing one.  The other is [1m\.[22m, which escapes the control  char‐
       acter.   It is used to permit nested macro definitions to end without a
       named macro call to conclude them.  Without a syntax for  escaping  the
       control  character,  this would not be possible.  [4mroff[24m documents should
       not use the [1m\\ [22mor [1m\. [22mcharacter sequences outside  of  copy  mode;  they
       serve  only  to  obfuscate  the  input.  Use [1m\e [22mto represent the escape
       character, [1m\[rs] [22mto obtain a backslash glyph, and [1m\&  [22mbefore  [1m.  [22mand  [1m'[0m
       where  [4mtroff[24m expects them as control characters if you mean to use them
       literally.

       Macro definitions can be nested to arbitrary depth.  In “[1m\\[22m”, each  es‐
       cape  character  is interpreted twice—once in copy mode, when the macro
       is defined, and once in interpretation mode, when the macro is  called.
       This fact leads to exponential growth in the quantity of escape charac‐
       ters required to delay interpolation of [1m\n[22m, [1m\g[22m, [1m\$[22m, [1m\*[22m, [1m\V[22m, and  [1m\?  [22mat
       each  nesting  level.  An alternative is to use [1m\E[22m, which represents an
       escape character that is not interpreted in copy mode.  Because  [1m\.  [22mis
       not  a true escape sequence, we can’t use [1m\E [22mto keep “[1m..[22m” from ending a
       macro definition prematurely.  If the multiplicity of backslashes  com‐
       plicates maintenance, use end macros.

[1mTraps[0m
       [4mTraps[24m  are  locations  in  the output, or conditions on the input that,
       when reached or fulfilled, call a specified macro.  A [4mvertical[24m [4mposition[0m
       [4mtrap[24m  calls  a  macro  when  the  formatter’s vertical drawing position
       reaches or passes, in the downward direction, a certain location on the
       output  page  or in a diversion.  Its applications include setting page
       headers and footers, body text  in  multiple  columns,  and  footnotes.
       These  traps can occur at a given location on the page ([1m.wh[22m, [1m.ch[22m); at a
       given location in the current diversion ([1m.dt[22m)—together, these are known
       as  vertical  position  traps,  which  can  be  disabled and re‐enabled
       ([1m.vpt[22m).

       A diversion is not formatted in the context of a page, so it lacks page
       location  traps; instead it can have a [4mdiversion[24m [4mtrap.[24m  There can exist
       at most one such vertical position trap per diversion.

       Other kinds of trap can be planted at a blank line ([1m.blm[22m);  at  a  line
       with leading space characters ([1m.lsm[22m); after a certain number of produc‐
       tive input lines ([1m.it[22m, [1m.itc[22m); or at the end  of  input  ([1m.em[22m).   Macros
       called by traps are passed no arguments.  Setting a trap is also called
       [4mplanting[24m one.  It is said that a trap is [4msprung[24m  if  its  condition  is
       fulfilled.

       Registers  associated  with  trap  management include vertical position
       trap enablement status ([1m\n[.vpt][22m), distance to the next trap  ([1m\n[.t][22m),
       amount of needed ([1m.ne[22m‐requested) space that caused the most recent ver‐
       tical position trap to be sprung  ([1m\n[.ne][22m),  amount  of  needed  space
       truncated  from the amount requested ([1m\n[.trunc][22m), page ejection status
       ([1m\n[.pe][22m), and leading space count ([1m\n[.lsn][22m)  with  its  corresponding
       amount of motion ([1m\n[.lss][22m).

   [1mPage location traps[0m
       A  [4mpage[24m  [4mlocation[24m  [4mtrap[24m is a vertical position trap that applies to the
       page; that is, to undiverted output.  Many can be present; manage  them
       with  the  [1mwh  [22mand  [1mch  [22mrequests.  Non‐negative page locations given to
       these requests set the trap relative to the top of the  page;  negative
       values set the trap relative to the bottom of the page.  It is not pos‐
       sible to plant a trap less than one basic unit from the page bottom:  a
       location of “-0” is interpreted as “0”, the top of the page.  An exist‐
       ing [4mvisible[24m trap (see below) at the same location is removed;  this  is
       [1m.wh[22m’s sole function if its second argument is missing.

       A  trap  is  sprung only if it is [4mvisible,[24m meaning that its location is
       reachable on the page and it is not hidden by another trap at the  same
       location  already  planted  there.   (A trap planted at “20i” or “-30i”
       will not be sprung on a page of length “11i”.)

       A trap above the top or at or below the bottom of the page can be  made
       visible  by  either moving it into the page area or increasing the page
       length so that the trap is on the page.  Negative  trap  values  always
       use the [4mcurrent[24m page length; they are not converted to an absolute ver‐
       tical position.  Use [1m.ptr [22mto dump page location traps to  the  standard
       error stream; their positions are reported in basic units.

   [1mThe implicit page trap[0m
       An  [4mimplicit[24m  [4mpage[24m  [4mtrap[24m  always  exists in the top‐level diversion; it
       works like a trap in some ways but not others.  Its purpose is to eject
       the  current page and start the next one.  It has no name, so it cannot
       be moved or deleted with [1mwh [22mor [1mch [22mrequests.   You  cannot  hide  it  by
       placing  another trap at its location, and can move it only by redefin‐
       ing the page length with [1m.pl[22m.  Its operation is suppressed when  verti‐
       cal page traps are disabled with the [1mvpt [22mrequest.

[1mDiversions[0m
       In [4mroff[24m systems it is possible to format text as if for output, but in‐
       stead of writing it immediately, one can [4mdivert[24m the formatted text into
       a named storage area.  It is retrieved later by specifying its name af‐
       ter a control character.  The same name space is used for  such  [4mdiver‐[0m
       [4msions[24m as for strings and macros; see section “Identifiers” above.  Such
       text is sometimes said to be “stored in a macro”, but this coinage  ob‐
       scures the important distinction between macros and strings on one hand
       and diversions on the other; the former store [4munformatted[24m  input  text,
       and the latter capture [4mformatted[24m output.  Diversions also do not inter‐
       pret arguments.  Applications of diversions include “keeps” (preventing
       a  page  break from occurring at an inconvenient place by forcing a set
       of output lines to be set as a group), footnotes, tables  of  contents,
       and  indices.   For  orthogonality  it is said that GNU [4mtroff[24m is in the
       [4mtop‐level[24m [4mdiversion[24m if no diversion is active (that is, formatted  out‐
       put is being “diverted” immediately to the output device.

       Dereferencing  an  undefined diversion will create an empty one of that
       name and cause a warning in category [1mmac [22mto be emitted.   (see  section
       “Warnings” in [4mtroff[24m(1)).  A diversion does not exist for the purpose of
       testing with the [1md [22mconditional operator until  its  initial  definition
       ends (see subsection “Conditional expressions” above).

       The  [1mdi  [22mrequest creates a diversion, including any partially collected
       line.  [1mda [22mappends to a diversion, creating one if it does  not  already
       exist.   If the diversion’s name already exists as an alias, the target
       of the alias is replaced or appended to; see section  “Strings”  above.
       [1mbox  [22mand  [1mboxa  [22mworks  similarly, but ignore partially collected lines.
       Call any of these macros again without an argument to  end  the  diver‐
       sion.

       Diversions  can be nested.  The registers [1m.d[22m, [1m.z[22m, [1mdn[22m, and [1mdl [22mreport in‐
       formation about the current (or last closed) diversion.  [1m.h [22mis meaning‐
       ful in diversions, including the top level.

       The  [1m\!   [22mand [1m\?  [22mescape sequences and [1moutput [22mrequest escape from a di‐
       version, the first two to the enclosing level and the last to  the  top
       level.  This facility is termed [4mtransparent[24m [4membedding[24m.

       The [1masciify [22mand [1munformat [22mrequests reprocess diversions.

[1mPunning names[0m
       Macros,  strings, and diversions share a name space; see section “Iden‐
       tifiers” above.  Internally, the same mechanism is used to store  them.
       You  can  thus  call  a macro with string interpolation syntax and vice
       versa.  Interpolating a string does not hide existing macro  arguments.
       The  sequence  [1m\\ [22mcan be placed at the end of a line in a macro defini‐
       tion or, within a macro definition, immediately after the interpolation
       of a macro as a string to suppress the effect of a newline.

[1mEnvironments[0m
       Environments store most of the parameters that control text processing.
       A default environment named “[1m0[22m” exists when [4mtroff[24m starts up; it is mod‐
       ified by formatting‐related requests and escape sequences.

       You  can  create  new  environments and switch among them.  Only one is
       current at any given time.  Active environments  are  managed  using  a
       [4mstack,[24m  a  data  structure supporting “push” and “pop” operations.  The
       current environment is at the top of the stack.  The  same  environment
       name  can be pushed onto the stack multiple times, possibly interleaved
       with others.  Popping the environment stack does not destroy  the  cur‐
       rent environment; it remains accessible by name and can be made current
       again by pushing it at any time.  Environments  cannot  be  renamed  or
       deleted,  and  can only be modified when current.  To inspect the envi‐
       ronment stack, use the [1mpev [22mrequest; see section “Debugging” below.

       Environments store the following information.

       • a partially collected line, if any

       • data about the most recently output glyph and line  (registers  [1m.cdp[22m,
         [1m.cht[22m, [1m.csk[22m, [1m.n[22m, [1m.w[22m)

       • typeface  parameters  (size,  family, style, height and slant, inter‐
         word and inter‐sentence space sizes)

       • page parameters (line length, title length,  vertical  spacing,  line
         spacing, indentation, line numbering, centering, right‐alignment, un‐
         derlining, hyphenation parameters)

[1mUnderlining[0m
       In [4mRUNOFF[24m (see [4mroff[24m(7)), underlining, even  of  lengthy  passages,  was
       straightforward  because  only  fixed‐pitch  printing devices were tar‐
       geted.  Typesetter output posed a greater challenge.   There  exists  a
       [4mgroff[24m  request  [1m.ul [22m(see above) that underlines subsequent source lines
       on terminal devices, but on typesetters,  it  selects  an  italic  font
       style  instead.   The [4mms[24m macro package (see [4mgroff_ms[24m(7)) offers a macro
       [1m.UL[22m, but it too produces the desired effect only  on  typesetters,  and
       has other limitations.

       One  could  adapt  [4mms[24m’s approach to the construction of a macro as fol‐
       lows.
              .de UNDERLINE
              . ie n \\$1\f[I]\\$2\f[P]\\$3
              . el \\$1\Z'\\$2'\v'.25m'\D'l \w'\\$2'u 0'\v'-.25m'\\$3
              ..
       If [4mdoclifter[24m(1) makes trouble, change the  macro  name  [1mUNDERLINE  [22minto
       some 2‐letter word, like [1mUl[22m.  Moreover, change the form of the font se‐
       lection escape sequence from [1m\f[P] [22mto [1m\fP[22m.

   [1mUnderlining without macro definitions[0m
       If one does not want to use macro  definitions,  e.g.,  when  [4mdoclifter[0m
       gets lost, use the following.
              .ds u1 before
              .ds u2 in
              .ds u3 after
              .ie n \*[u1]\f[I]\*[u2]\f[P]\*[u3]
              .el \*[u1]\Z'\*[u2]'\v'.25m'\D'l \w'\*[u2]'u 0'\v'-.25m'\*[u3]
       When using [4mdoclifter[24m, it might be necessary to change syntax forms such
       as [1m\[xy] [22mand [1m\*[xy] [22mto those supported by AT&T [4mtroff[24m: [1m\*(xy  [22mand  [1m\(xy[22m,
       and so on.

       Then these lines could look like
              .ds u1 before
              .ds u2 in
              .ds u3 after
              .ie n \*[u1]\fI\*(u2\fP\*(u3
              .el \*(u1\Z'\*(u2'\v'.25m'\D'l \w'\*(u2'u 0'\v'-.25m'\*(u3

       The result looks like
              before _i_n after

   [1mUnderlining by overstriking with \(ul[0m
       The [1m\z [22mescape sequence writes a glyph without advancing the drawing po‐
       sition, enabling overstriking.  Thus, [1m\z[4m[22mc[24m[1m\(ul [22mformats [4mc[24m with an  under‐
       rule  glyph  on  top of it.  Video terminals implement the underrule by
       setting a character cell’s underline attribute, so this technique works
       in both [4mnroff[24m and [4mtroff[24m modes.

       Long  words  may  then look intimidating in the input; a clarifying ap‐
       proach might be to use the  input  line  continuation  escape  sequence

       groff_char - GNU [4mroff[24m special character and glyph repertoire

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m typesetting system has a large glyph repertoire suitable
       for production of varied literary, professional, technical, and  mathe‐
       matical  documents.  [4mgroff[24m works with [4mcharacters;[24m an output device ren‐
       ders [4mglyphs.[24m  [4mgroff[24m’s input character set is restricted to that defined
       by  the  standards  ISO Latin‐1 (ISO 8859‐1) and CCSID “code page” 1047
       (an EBCDIC arrangement of Latin‐1).  For ease of  document  maintenance
       in  UTF‐8  environments,  it is advisable to use only the Unicode basic
       Latin code points, a subset of all of the  foregoing  historically  re‐
       ferred  to  as  US‐ASCII,  which  has  only  94 visible, printable code
       points.  In [4mgroff,[24m these are termed [4mordinary[24m [4mcharacters.[24m   Often,  many
       more are desired in output.

       AT&T [4mtroff[24m in the 1970s faced a similar problem: the available typeset‐
       ter’s glyph repertoire differed from that of the  computers  that  con‐
       trolled  it.  [4mtroff[24m’s solution was a form of escape sequence known as a
       [4mspecial[24m [4mcharacter[24m to access several dozen additional  glyphs  available
       in  the  fonts  prepared  for  mounting  in the phototypesetter.  These
       glyphs were mapped onto a two‐character name  space  for  a  degree  of
       mnemonic  convenience; for example, the escape sequence [1m\(aa [22mencoded an
       acute accent and [1m\(sc [22ma section sign.

       [4mgroff[24m has lifted historical [4mroff[24m limitations on special character  name
       lengths,  but  recognizes and retains compatibility with the historical
       names.  [4mgroff[24m expands the lexicon of glyphs available by name and  per‐
       mits  users to define their own special character escape sequences with
       the [1mchar [22mrequest.  Special character names are [4mgroff[24m  identifiers;  see
       section  “Identifiers”  in  [4mgroff[24m(7).   Our  discussion  uses the terms
       “glyph name” and “special character name” interchangeably; we assume no
       character translations or redefinitions.

       This  document  lists all of the glyph names predefined by [4mgroff[24m’s font
       description files and presents the systematic notation by which it  en‐
       ables  access to arbitrary Unicode code points and construction of com‐
       posite glyphs.  Glyphs listed may be unavailable, or may  vary  in  ap‐
       pearance,  depending on the output device and font chosen when the page
       was formatted.  This page was rendered for device [1mutf8 [22musing font [1mR[22m.

       A few escape sequences that are not [4mgroff[24m special characters also  pro‐
       duce  glyphs;  these  exist for syntactical or historical reasons.  [1m\'[22m,
       [1m\`[22m, [1m\-[22m, and [1m\_ [22mare translated on input to the special character  escape
       sequences  [1m\[aa][22m, [1m\[ga][22m, [1m\[-][22m, and [1m\[ul][22m, respectively.  Others include
       [1m\\[22m, [1m\. [22m(backslash‐dot), and [1m\e[22m; see [4mgroff[24m(7).  A small number  of  spe‐
       cial characters represent glyphs that are not encoded in Unicode; exam‐
       ples include the baseline rule [1m\[ru] [22mand the Bell System logo [1m\[bs].[0m

       In [4mgroff[24m, you can test output device support for any  character  (ordi‐
       nary or special) with the conditional expression operator “[1mc[22m”.

       For  brevity  in the remainder of this document, we shall refer to sys‐
       tems conforming to the ISO 646:1991 IRV, ISO 8859, or ISO 10646  (“Uni‐
       code”) character encoding standards as “ISO” systems, and those employ‐
       ing IBM code page 1047 as “EBCDIC” systems.  That said, EBCDIC  systems
       that support [4mgroff[24m are known to also support UTF‐8.

       While  [4mgroff[24m  accepts eight‐bit encoded input, not all such code points
       are valid as input.  On ISO platforms, character codes  0,  11,  13–31,
       and  128–159  are  invalid.  (This is all C0 and C1 controls except for
       SOH through LF [Control+A  to  Control+J],  and  FF  [Control+L].)   On
       EBCDIC  platforms,  0,  8–9,  11,  13–20, 23–31, and 48–63 are invalid.
       Some of these code points are used  by  [4mgroff[24m  for  internal  purposes,
       which is one reason it does not support UTF‐8 natively.

   [1mFundamental character set[0m
       The ordinary characters catalogued above, plus the space, tab, newline,
       and leader (Control+A), form the fundamental character  set  for  [4mgroff[0m
       input;  anything  in the language, even over one million code points in
       Unicode, can be expressed using it.  On ISO systems, code points in the
       range  33–126  comprise  a common set of printable glyphs in all of the
       aforementioned ISO character encoding standards.  It is this  character
       set  and  (with  some  noteworthy  exceptions)  the corresponding glyph
       repertoire for which AT&T [4mtroff[24m was implemented.   On  EBCDIC  systems,
       printable characters are in the range 66–201 and 203–254; those without
       counterparts in the ISO range 33–126 are discussed in the next  subsec‐
       tion.

       All of the following characters map to glyphs as you would expect.

       others intimately familiar with the ISO character encodings.   The  de‐
       velopers of AT&T [4mtroff[24m chose mappings for them that would be useful for
       typesetting technical literature in a broad range of scientific  disci‐
       plines: Bell Labs used the system for preparation of AT&T’s patent fil‐
       ings with the U.S. government.  Further, the prevailing  character  en‐
       coding  standard  in  the 1970s, USAS X3.4‐1968 (“ASCII”), deliberately
       supported semantic ambiguity at some code points, and outright  substi‐
       tution  at  several others, to suit the localization demands of various
       national standards bodies.

       The table below presents the seven exceptional code points  with  their
       typical  keycap  engravings, their glyph mappings and semantics in [4mroff[0m
       systems, and the escape sequences producing  the  Unicode  basic  Latin
       character they replace.  The first, the neutral double quote, is a par‐
       tial exception because it does represent itself,  but  since  the  [4mroff[0m
       language  also  uses it to quote macro arguments, [4mgroff[24m supports a spe‐
       cial character escape sequence as an alternative form so that the glyph
       can be easily included in macro arguments without requiring the user to
       master the quoting rules that AT&T  [4mtroff[24m  required  in  that  context.
       (Some requests, like [1mds[22m, also treat [1m" [22mnon‐literally.)  Furthermore, not
       all of the special character escape  sequences  are  portable  to  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m  and all of its descendants; these [4mgroff[24m extensions are presented
       using its special character form [1m\[][22m, whereas portable special  charac‐
       ter  escape  sequences are shown in the traditional [1m\( [22mform.  [1m\- [22mand [1m\e[0m
       are portable to all known [4mtroff[24ms.  [1m\e [22mmeans “the glyph of  the  current
       escape character”; it therefore can produce unexpected output if the [1mec[0m
       request is used.  On devices with a limited glyph repertoire, glyphs in
       the  “keycap” and “appearance” columns on the same row of the table may
       look identical; except for the neutral double quote, this will  [4mnot[24m  be
       the  case  on more‐capable devices.  Review your document using as many
       different output devices as possible.

       The hyphen‐minus is a particularly  unfortunate  case  of  overloading.
       Its awkward name in ISO 8859 and later standards reflects the many dis‐
       tinguishable purposes to which it had already been put  by  the  1980s,
       including  a  hyphen, a minus sign, and (alone or in repetition) dashes
       of varying widths.  For best results in [4mroff[24m systems, use the “[1m-[22m” char‐
       acter  in input outside an escape sequence [4monly[24m to mean a hyphen, as in
       the phrase “long‐term”.  For a minus sign in running  text  or  a  Unix
       command‐line option dash, use [1m\- [22m(or [1m\[-] [22min [4mgroff[24m if you find it helps
       the clarity of the source document).  (Another minus sign, for  use  in
       mathematical  equations,  is available as [1m\[mi][22m).  AT&T [4mtroff[24m supported
       em‐dashes as [1m\(em[22m, as does [4mgroff[24m.

       The special character escape sequence for the apostrophe as  a  neutral
       single  quote  is  typically  needed  only in technical content; typing
       words like “can’t” and “Anne’s” in a natural way will render correctly,
       because  in ordinary prose an apostrophe is typeset either as a closing
       single quotation mark or as a neutral single quote,  depending  on  the
       capabilities  of the output device.  By contrast, special character es‐
       cape sequences should be used for quotation marks unless portability to
       limited or historical [4mtroff[24m implementations is necessary; on those sys‐
       tems, the input convention is to pair the grave accent with  the  apos‐
       trophe  for  single  quotes,  and  to double both characters for double
       quotes.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m defined no special characters for  quotation  marks
       or  the apostrophe.  Repeated single quotes (‘‘thus’’) will be visually
       distinguishable from double quotes (“thus”) on  terminal  devices,  and
       perhaps on others (depending on the font selected).

       Using Unicode basic Latin characters to compose boxes and lines is ill‐
       advised.  [4mroff[24m systems have special characters for  drawing  horizontal
       and vertical lines; see subsection “Rules and lines” below.  Preproces‐
       sors like [4mtbl[24m(1) and [4mpic[24m(1) draw boxes and will produce the best possi‐
       ble output for the device, falling back to basic Latin glyphs only when
       necessary.

   [1mEight‐bit encodings and Latin‐1 supplement[0m
       ISO 646 is a seven‐bit code encoding 128 code points;  eight‐bit  codes
       are  twice the size.  ISO 8859‐1 and code page 1047 allocated the addi‐
       tional space to what Unicode calls “C1 controls”  (control  characters)
       and  the  “Latin‐1  supplement”.  The C1 controls are neither printable
       nor usable as [4mgroff[24m input.

       Two Latin‐1 supplement  characters  are  handled  specially  on  input.
       [4mtroff[24m never produces them as output.

       NBSP   encodes  a  no‐break  space;  it is mapped to [1m\~[22m, the adjustable
              non‐breaking space escape sequence.

       SHY    encodes a soft hyphen; it is mapped to [1m\%[22m, the hyphenation  con‐
              trol escape sequence.

       The  remaining  characters  in  the  Latin‐1 supplement represent them‐
       selves.  Although they can be specified directly with the  keyboard  on
       systems configured to use Latin‐1 as the character encoding, it is more
       portable, both to other [4mroff[24m systems and to UTF‐8 environments, to  use
       their  special  character escape sequences, shown below.  The glyph de‐
       scriptions we use are non‐standard in some cases, for brevity.

   [1mSpecial character escape forms[0m
       Glyphs that lack a character code in the basic Latin repertoire to  di‐
       rectly  represent  them are entered by one of several special character
       escape forms.  Such glyphs can be simple or composite, and accessed ei‐
       ther  by  name or numerically by code point.  Code points and combining
       properties are determined  by  character  encoding  standards,  whereas
       glyph names as used here originated in AT&T [4mtroff[24m special character es‐
       cape sequences.  Predefined glyph names use only characters in the  ba‐
       sic Latin repertoire.

       [1m\([4m[22mgl[24m   is  a  special  character escape sequence for the glyph with the
              two‐character name [4mgl[24m.  This is the original  syntax  form  sup‐
              ported by AT&T [4mtroff[24m.  The acute accent, [1m\(aa[22m, is an example.

       [1m\C'[4m[22mglyph‐name[24m[1m'[0m
              is a special character escape sequence for [4mglyph‐name[24m, which can
              be of arbitrary length.  The delimiter, shown here as a  neutral
              apostrophe,  can  be  any character not occurring in [4mglyph‐name[24m.
              This syntax form was introduced in later versions  of  AT&T  de‐
              vice‐independent  [4mtroff[24m.  The foregoing acute accent example can
              be expressed as [1m\C'aa'[22m.

       [1m\[[4m[22mglyph‐name[24m[1m][0m
              is a special character escape sequence for [4mglyph‐name[24m, which can
              be  of  arbitrary  length  but must not contain a closing square
              bracket “[1m][22m”.  (No glyph names predefined by [4mgroff[24m  employ  “[1m][22m”.)
              The  foregoing acute accent example can be expressed in [4mgroff[24m as
              [1m\[aa][22m.

       [1m\C'[4m[22mc[24m[1m' [22mand [1m\[[4m[22mc[24m[1m] [22mare not synonyms for the ordinary character “[4mc[24m”, but re‐
       quest  the  special  character  named “[1m\[4m[22mc[24m”.  For example, “[1m\[a][22m” is not
       “a”, but rather a special character with the internal glyph name  (used
       in  font  description files and diagnostic messages) [1m\a[22m, which is typi‐
       cally undefined.  The only such glyph name [4mgroff[24m predefines is the  mi‐
       nus sign, which can therefore be accessed as [1m\C'-' [22mor [1m\[-][22m.

       [1m\[[4m[22mbase‐char[24m [4mcomposite‐1[24m [4mcomposite‐2[24m ... [4mcomposite‐n[24m[1m][0m
              is a composite glyph.  Glyphs like a lowercase “e” with an acute
              accent, as in the word “café”, can be expressed as [1m\[e aa][22m.  See
              subsection “Accents” below for a table of combining glyph names.

       Unicode  encodes  far  more  characters than [4mgroff[24m has glyph names for;
       special character escape forms based on numerical  code  points  enable
       access  to  any  of them.  Frequently used glyphs or glyph combinations
       can be stored in strings, and new glyph names can  be  created  [4mad[24m  [4mhoc[0m
       with the [1mchar [22mrequest; see [4mgroff[24m(7).

       [1m\[u[4m[22mnnnn[24m[[4mn[24m[[4mn[24m]][1m][0m
              is  a  Unicode  numeric  special character escape sequence.  Any
              Unicode code point can be accessed with four to six  hexadecimal
              digits,  with  hexadecimal  letters  accepted  in uppercase form
              only.  Thus, [1m\[u02DA] [22maccesses the (spacing) ring  accent,  pro‐
              ducing “˚”.

       Unicode  code  points can be composed as well; when they are, GNU [4mtroff[0m
       requires NFD (Normalization Form D), where all Unicode glyphs are maxi‐
       mally  decomposed.   (Exception:  precomposed characters in the Latin‐1
       supplement described above are also accepted.  Do not count on this ex‐
       ception  remaining  in  a future GNU [4mtroff[24m that accepts UTF‐8 input di‐
       rectly.)   Thus,  GNU  [4mtroff[24m  accepts  “caf[1m\['e][22m”,  “caf[1m\[e  aa][22m”,  and
       “caf[1m\[u0065_0301][22m”,  as ways to input “café”.  (Due to its legacy 8‐bit
       encoding compatibility, at present it also accepts “caf[1m\[u00E9][22m” on ISO
       Latin‐1 systems.)

       [1m\[u[4m[22mbase‐char[24m[[1m_[4m[22mcombining‐component[24m]...]
              constructs  a composite glyph from Unicode numeric special char‐
              acter escape sequences.  The code points of the base  glyph  and
              the combining components are each expressed in hexadecimal, with
              an   underscore   ([1m_[22m)   separating   each   component.     Thus,
              [1m\[u006E_0303] [22mproduces “ñ”.

       [1m\[char[4m[22mnnn[24m[1m][0m
              expresses an eight‐bit code point where [4mnnn[24m is the code point of
              the character, a decimal number between 0 and 255 without  lead‐
              ing  zeroes.   This  legacy numeric special character escape se‐
              quence is used to map characters onto glyphs via  the  [1mtrin  [22mre‐
              quest in macro files loaded by [4mgrotty[24m(1).

[1mGlyph tables[0m
       In  this section, [4mgroff[24m’s glyph name repertoire is presented in tabular
       form.  The meanings of the columns are as follows.

       [1mOutput  [22mshows the glyph as it appears on the device used to render this
               document;  although  it  can  have a notably different shape on
               other devices (and is subject to user‐directed translation  and
               replacement), [4mgroff[24m attempts reasonable equivalency on all out‐
               put devices.

       [1mInput   [22mshows the [4mgroff[24m character (ordinary or special)  that  normally
               produces  the  glyph.   Some  code  points  have multiple glyph
               names.

       [1mUnicode [22mis the code point notation for the glyph or combining glyph se‐
               quence  as  described  in  subsection “Special character escape
               forms” above.  It corresponds to the standard notation for Uni‐
               code short identifiers such that [4mgroff[24m’s [1mu[4m[22mnnnn[24m is equivalent to
               Unicode’s U+[4mnnnn[24m.

       [1mNotes   [22mdescribes the glyph, elucidating  the  mnemonic  value  of  the
               glyph name where possible.

               A  plus  sign  “+” indicates that the glyph name appears in the
               AT&T [4mtroff[24m user’s manual, CSTR #54 (1992 revision).  When using
               the  AT&T special character syntax [1m\([4m[22mxx[24m, widespread portability
               can be expected from such names.

               Entries marked with “***” denote glyphs used  for  mathematical
               purposes.   On  typesetting  devices, such glyphs are typically
               drawn from a [4mspecial[24m font  (see  [4mgroff_font[24m(5)).   Often,  such
               glyphs  lack  bold  or  italic style forms or have metrics that
               look incongruous in ordinary prose.  A few which are not uncom‐
               mon  in  running  text  have “text variants”, which should work
               better in that context.  Conversely, a handful of  glyphs  that
               are  normally  drawn from a text font may be required in mathe‐
               matical equations.  Both sets of exceptions are  noted  in  the
               tables  where  they appear (“Logical symbols” and “Mathematical
               symbols”).

   [1mBasic Latin[0m
       Apart from basic Latin characters with special mappings,  described  in
       subsection  “Fundamental  character  set”  above,  a few others in that
       range have special character glyph names.  These were defined for  ease
       of  input on non‐U.S. keyboards lacking keycaps for them, or for symme‐
       try with other special character glyph names serving a similar purpose.

       The vertical bar is overloaded; the [1m\[ba] [22mand  [1m\[or]  [22mescape  sequences
       may  render  differently.   See subsection “Mathematical symbols” below
       for special variants of the plus,  minus,  and  equals  signs  normally
       drawn from this range.

       Normally,  the  formatting  of a special character advances the drawing
       position as an ordinary character does.  [4mgroff[24m’s [1mcomposite [22mrequest des‐
       ignates  a  special  character  as combining.  The [4mcomposite.tmac[24m macro

   [1mBrackets[0m
       On  typesetting  devices,  the  bracket  extensions  are font‐invariant
       glyphs; that is, they are rendered the  same  way  regardless  of  font
       (with  a drawing escape sequence).  On terminals, they are [4mnot[24m font‐in‐
       variant; [4mgroff[24m maps them rather arbitrarily to U+23AA  (“curly  bracket
       extension”).  In AT&T [4mtroff[24m, only one glyph was available to vertically
       extend brackets, braces, and parentheses: [1m\(bv[22m.

       Not all devices supply bracket pieces that can be piled up with [1m\b  [22mdue
       to  the restrictions of the escape’s piling algorithm.  A general solu‐
       tion to build brackets out of pieces is the following macro:
              .\" Make a pile centered vertically 0.5em above the baseline.
              .\" The first argument is placed at the top.
              .\" The pile is returned in string 'pile'.
              .eo
              .de pile-make
              .  nr pile-wd 0
              .  nr pile-ht 0
              .  ds pile-args
              .
              .  nr pile-# \n[.$]
              .  while \n[pile-#] \{\
              .    nr pile-wd (\n[pile-wd] >? \w'\$[\n[pile-#]]')
              .    nr pile-ht +(\n[rst] - \n[rsb])
              .    as pile-args \v'\n[rsb]u'\"
              .    as pile-args \Z'\$[\n[pile-#]]'\"
              .    as pile-args \v'-\n[rst]u'\"
              .    nr pile-# -1
              .  \}
              .
              .  ds pile \v'(-0.5m + (\n[pile-ht]u / 2u))'\"
              .  as pile \*[pile-args]\"
              .  as pile \v'((\n[pile-ht]u / 2u) + 0.5m)'\"
              .  as pile \h'\n[pile-wd]u'\"
              ..
              .ec

       Another complication is the  fact  that  some  glyphs  which  represent
       bracket pieces in AT&T [4mtroff[24m can be used for other mathematical symbols
       as well, for example [1m\(lf [22mand [1m\(rf[22m, which provide the  floor  operator.
       Some  output  devices,  such as [1mdvi[22m, don’t unify such glyphs.  For this
       reason, the glyphs [1m\[lf][22m, [1m\[rf][22m, [1m\[lc][22m, and [1m\[rc] [22mare not unified  with
       similar‐looking  bracket pieces.  In [4mgroff[24m, only glyphs with long names
       are guaranteed to pile up  correctly  for  all  devices—provided  those
       glyphs are available.

[1mHistory[0m
       A consideration of the typefaces originally available to AT&T [4mnroff[24m and
       [4mtroff[24m illuminates many conventions that one might  regard  as  idiosyn‐
       cratic  fifty  years  afterward.  (See section “History” of [4mroff[24m(7) for
       more context.)  The face used by the Teletype Model 37 terminals of the
       Murray  Hill  Unix Room was based on ASCII, but assigned multiple mean‐
       ings to several code points, as suggested by that standard.  Decimal 34
       ([1m"[22m) served as a dieresis accent and neutral double quotation mark; dec‐
       imal 39 ([1m'[22m) as an acute accent, apostrophe, and closing (right)  single
       quotation mark; decimal 45 ([1m-[22m) as a hyphen and a minus sign; decimal 94
       ([1m^[22m) as a circumflex accent and caret; decimal 96 ([1m`[22m) as a grave  accent
       and  opening  (left)  single  quotation  mark; and decimal 126 ([1m~[22m) as a
       tilde accent and (with a half‐line motion) swung dash.   The  Model  37
       bore  an optional extended character set offering upright Greek letters
       and several mathematical symbols; these were documented as early as the
       [4mkbd[24m(VII) man page of the (First Edition) [4mUnix[24m [4mProgrammer’s[24m [4mManual.[0m

       At  the  time  Graphic  Systems  delivered the C/A/T phototypesetter to
       AT&T, the ASCII character set was not considered a standard basis for a
       glyph  repertoire  by traditional typographers.  In the stock Times ro‐
       man, italic, and bold styles available, several ASCII  characters  were
       not  present  at all, nor was most of the Teletype’s extended character
       set.  AT&T commissioned a “special” font to ensure no  loss  of  reper‐
       toire.

       A  representation  of  the  coverage of the C/A/T’s text fonts follows.
       The glyph resembling an underscore is a baseline rule, and that  resem‐
       bling  a vertical line is a box rule.  In italics, the box rule was not
       slanted.  We also observe that the hyphen and minus sign  were  already
       “de‐unified”  by the fonts provided; a decision whither to map an input
       “-” therefore had to be taken.

       The special font supplied  the  missing  ASCII  and  Teletype  extended
       glyphs,  among  several  others.  The plus, minus, and equals signs ap‐
       peared in the special font despite availability in text fonts “to insu‐
       late  the  appearance  of  equations from the choice of standard [read:
       text] fonts”—a priority since [4mtroff[24m was turned to the task of mathemat‐
       ical typesetting as soon as it was developed.

       We note that AT&T took the opportunity to de‐unify the apostrophe/right
       single quotation mark from the acute accent (a choice ISO later  dupli‐
       cated in its 8859 series of standards).  A slash intended to be mirror‐
       symmetric with the backslash was also included, as was the Bell  System
       logo; we do not attempt to depict the latter.

       One  ASCII  character  as rendered by the Model 37 was apparently aban‐
       doned.  That device printed decimal 124 (|) as a broken vertical  line,
       like Unicode U+00A6 (¦).  No equivalent was available on the C/A/T; the
       box rule [1m\[br][22m, brace vertical extension [1m\[bv][22m, and “or” operator [1m\[or][0m
       were used as contextually appropriate.

       Devices  supported by AT&T device‐independent [4mtroff[24m exhibited some dif‐

       groff_diff - differences between GNU [4mroff[24m and AT&T [4mtroff[0m

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  [4mroff[24m  text  processing system, [4mgroff[24m, is an extension of AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m, the typesetting system originating in Unix systems of the 1970s.
       [4mgroff[24m removes many arbitrary limitations and adds features, both to the
       input language and to the page description language output by the [4mtroff[0m
       formatter.   Differences  arising  from  [4mgroff[24m’s implementation of AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m features are also noted.  See [4mroff[24m(7) for background.

[1mLanguage[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m features identifiers of arbitrary length; supports color out‐
       put,  non‐integral  type  sizes, and user‐defined characters; adds more
       conditional expression operators; recognizes additional  scaling  units
       and  numeric  operators;  enables  general  file  I/O (in “unsafe mode”
       only); and exposes more formatter state.

   [1mLong names[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m introduces many new requests; with three exceptions ([1mcp[22m,  [1mdo[22m,
       [1mrj[22m),  they  have names longer than two characters.  The names of regis‐
       ters, fonts, strings/macros/diversions, environments,  special  charac‐
       ters,  streams,  and  colors can be of any length.  Anywhere AT&T [4mtroff[0m
       supports a parameterized escape sequence that uses an opening parenthe‐
       sis “(” to introduce a two‐character argument, [4mgroff[24m supports a square‐
       bracketed form “[]” where the  argument  within  can  be  of  arbitrary
       length.

   [1mFont families, abstract styles, and translation[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m can group text typefaces into [4mfamilies[24m containing each of the
       styles “[1mR[22m”, “[1mI[22m”, “[1mB[22m”, and “[1mBI[22m”.  So that a document need not be coupled
       to  a  specific  font family, an output device can associate a style in
       the abstract sense with a mounting position.  Thus the  default  family
       can  be  combined  with  a style dynamically, producing a [4mresolved[24m [4mfont[0m
       [4mname.[24m  A document can [4mtranslate,[24m or remap, fonts with the [1mftr [22mrequest.

       Applying the requests [1mcs[22m, [1mbd[22m, [1mtkf[22m, [1muf[22m, or [1mfspecial [22mto an abstract style
       affects  the  member of the default family corresponding to that style.
       The default family can be set with the [1mfam [22mrequest or  [1m-f  [22mcommand‐line
       option.  The [1mstyles [22mdirective in the output device’s [4mDESC[24m file controls
       which mounting positions (if any) are  initially  associated  with  ab‐
       stract  styles  rather  than fonts, and the [1msty [22mrequest can update this
       association.

   [1mColors[0m
       [4mgroff[24m supports color output with a variety of color spaces and up to 16
       bits  per  channel.   Some devices, particularly terminals, may be more
       limited.  When color support is enabled, two colors are current at  any
       given  time:  the  [4mstroke[24m  [4mcolor,[24m with which glyphs, rules (lines), and
       geometric figures are drawn, and the [4mfill[24m [4mcolor,[24m which paints the inte‐
       rior  of  filled  geometric  figures.  The [1mcolor[22m, [1mdefcolor[22m, [1mgcolor[22m, and
       [1mfcolor [22mrequests; [1m\m [22mand [1m\M [22mescape sequences; and  [1m.color[22m,  [1m.m[22m,  and  [1m.M[0m
       registers exercise color support.

   [1mFractional type sizes and new scaling units[0m
       AT&T  [4mtroff[24m interpreted all type size measurements in points.  Combined
       with integer arithmetic, this design choice made it impossible to  sup‐
       port, for instance, ten and a half‐point type.  In GNU [4mtroff[24m, an output
       device can select a scaling factor that subdivides a point into “scaled
       points”.   A  type size expressed in scaled points can thus represent a
       non‐integral type size.

       A [4mscaled[24m [4mpoint[24m is equal to 1/[4msizescale[24m points, where [4msizescale[24m is spec‐
       ified  in  the  device  description  file, [4mDESC[24m, and defaults to 1; see
       [4mgroff_font[24m(5).  Requests and escape sequences in  GNU  [4mtroff[24m  interpret
       arguments  that  represent  a  type size in points, which the formatter
       multiplies by [4msizescale[24m and converts to an integer.  Arguments  treated
       in  this  way  comprise those to the escape sequences [1m\H [22mand [1m\s[22m, to the
       request [1mps[22m, the third argument to the [1mcs [22mrequest, and  the  second  and
       fourth  arguments  to  the [1mtkf [22mrequest.  Scaled points may be specified
       explicitly with the [1mz [22mscaling unit.  In GNU [4mtroff[24m, the register  [1m\n[.s][0m
       can  interpolate a non‐integral type size.  The register [1m\n[.ps] [22minter‐
       polates the type size in scaled points.

       For example, if [4msizescale[24m is 1000, then a scaled  point  is  one  thou‐
       sandth  of  a  point.  Consequently, “[1m.ps 10.5[22m” is synonymous with “[1m.ps[0m
       [1m10.5z[22m”; both set the type size to 10,500 scaled points, or 10.5 points.

       It makes no sense to use the “[1mz[22m” scaling unit in a  numeric  expression
       whose  default scaling unit is neither “[1mu[22m” nor “[1mz[22m”, so GNU [4mtroff[24m disal‐
       lows this.  Similarly, it is nonsensical to use a  scaling  unit  other
       than  “[1mz[22m”  or  “[1mu[22m”  in  a numeric expression whose default scaling unit
       is “[1mz[22m”, so GNU [4mtroff[24m disallows this as well.

       Another new scaling unit, “[1ms[22m”, multiplies by the number of basic  units
       in  a  scaled  point.  Thus, “[1m\n[.ps]s[22m” is equal to “[1m1m[22m” by definition.
       Do not confuse the “[1ms[22m” and “[1mz[22m” scaling units.

       Output devices may be limited in the type sizes they can  employ.   The
       [1m.s  [22mand [1m.ps [22mregisters represent the type size as selected by the output
       driver as it understands a device’s  capability.   The  last  [4mrequested[0m
       type  size  is  interpolated in scaled points by the read‐only register
       [1m.psr [22mand in points as a decimal fraction by the read‐only string‐valued
       register  [1m.sr[22m.  Both are associated with the environment.  For example,
       if a type size of 10.95 points is requested, and the nearest size  per‐
       mitted  by  a [1msizes [22mrequest (or by the [1msizes [22mor [1msizescale [22mdirectives in
       the device’s [4mDESC[24m file) is 11 points, the output driver uses the latter
       value.

       A  further  two new measurement units available in [4mgroff[24m are “[1mM[22m”, which
       indicates hundredths of an em, and “[1mf[22m”,  which  multiplies  by  65,536.
       The latter provides convenient fractions for color definitions with the
       [1mdefcolor [22mrequest.  For example, 0.5f equals 32768u.

   [1mNumeric expressions[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m permits spaces in a numeric  expression  within  parentheses,
       and offers three new operators.

   [1mDrawing commands[0m
       GNU  [4mtroff[24m  offers  drawing  commands  to create filled circles and el‐
       lipses, and polygons.  Stroked (outlined) objects are  drawn  with  the
       stroke color and filled (solid) ones shaded with the fill color.  These
       are independent properties; if you want a filled, stroked  figure,  you
       must  draw  the same figure twice using each drawing command.  A filled
       figure is always smaller than a stroked one because the former is drawn
       only  within  its  defined  area, whereas strokes have a line thickness
       (set with another new drawing command, [1m\D't'[22m).

   [1mEscape sequences[0m
       [4mgroff[24m introduces several new escape sequences and extends the syntax of
       a  few AT&T [4mtroff[24m escape sequences (namely, [1m\D[22m, [1m\f[22m, [1m\k[22m, [1m\n[22m, [1m\s[22m, [1m\$[22m, and
       [1m\*[22m).  In the following list, escape sequences are  collated  alphabeti‐
       cally at first, and then by symbol roughly in Unicode code point order.

              Interpolate  1  if  [4manything[24m is a valid identifier, and 0 other‐
              wise.  Because invalid input  characters  are  removed,  invalid
              identifiers are empty or contain spaces, tabs, or newlines.  You
              can employ [1m\A [22mto validate a macro argument before  using  it  to
              construct another escape sequence or identifier.

              Interpolate  1  if [4manything[24m is a valid numeric expression, and 0

              italic “f” is followed immediately by a roman right parenthesis,
              then in many fonts the top right portion of the “f” overlaps the
              top left of the right parenthesis, which is ugly.  Inserting  [1m\/[0m
              between  them  avoids  this  problem.   Use this escape sequence
              whenever an oblique glyph is immediately followed by an  upright
              glyph without any intervening space.

              gument is the sum of the desired flags and the  remaining  argu‐
              ments  are  the  characters  to  be  assigned  those properties.
              Spaces between the [4mcn[24m arguments are optional.  Any  argument  [4mcn[0m

              Some combinations are nonsensical, such as “[1m33[22m” (1 + 32).

              1      Recognize  the character as ending a sentence if followed
                     by a newline or two spaces.  Initially, characters  “[1m.?![22m”
                     have this property.

              2      Enable breaks before the character.  A line is not broken
                     at a character with this property unless  the  characters
                     on  each side both have non‐zero hyphenation codes.  This
                     exception can be overridden by adding 64.  Initially,  no
                     characters have this property.

              4      Enable  breaks after the character.  A line is not broken
                     at a character with this property unless  the  characters
                     on  each side both have non‐zero hyphenation codes.  This
                     exception can be overridden  by  adding  64.   Initially,
                     characters “[1m-\[hy]\[em][22m” have this property.

              8      Mark the glyph associated with this character as overlap‐
                     ping other instances of itself horizontally.   Initially,
                     characters   “[1m\[ul]\[rn]\[ru]\[radicalex]\[sqrtex][22m”  have
                     this property.

              16     Mark the glyph associated with this character as overlap‐
                     ping  other  instances  of itself vertically.  Initially,
                     the character “[1m\[br][22m” has this property.

              32     Mark the character as transparent for the purpose of end‐
                     of‐sentence  recognition.  In other words, an end‐of‐sen‐
                     tence character followed by any number of characters with
                     this property is treated as the end of a sentence if fol‐
                     lowed by a newline or two spaces.  This is  the  same  as
                     having a zero space factor in TeX.  Initially, characters
                     “[1m'")]*\[dg]\[dd]\[rq]\[cq][22m” have this property.

              64     Ignore hyphenation codes of the  surrounding  characters.
                     Use  this value in combination with values 2 and 4.  Ini‐
                     tially, no characters have this property.

                     For example, if you need an automatic break  point  after
                     the en‐dash in numeric ranges like “3000–5000”, insert
                            .cflags 68 \[en]
                     into your document.  However, this can lead to bad layout
                     if done without thinking; in most  situations,  a  better
                     solution than changing the [1mcflags [22mvalue is inserting “[1m\:[22m”
                     right after the hyphen at the places that really  need  a
                     break point.

              The  remaining  values  were implemented for East Asian language
              support; those who use alphabetic scripts exclusively can disre‐
              gard them.

              128    Prohibit  a break before the character, but allow a break
                     after the character.  This works only in combination with
                     values  256  and  512  and has no effect otherwise.  Ini‐
                     tially, no characters have this property.

              256    Prohibit a break after the character, but allow  a  break
                     before  the  character.   This  works only in combination
                     with values 128 and 512  and  has  no  effect  otherwise.
                     Initially, no characters have this property.

              512    Allow  a break before or after the character.  This works
                     only in combination with values 128 and 256  and  has  no
                     effect  otherwise.   Initially,  no  characters have this
                     property.

              In contrast to values 2 and 4, the values 128, 256, and 512 work
              pairwise.   If,  for  example, the left character has value 512,
              and the right character 128, no break will be automatically  in‐
              serted  between  them.   If  we use value 6 instead for the left
              character, a break after the character can’t be suppressed since
              the neighboring character on the right doesn’t get examined.

              formatted,  [4mcontents[24m is processed in a temporary environment and
              the result is wrapped up into a  single  object.   Compatibility
              mode  is  turned  off and the escape character is set to [1m\ [22mwhile
              [4mcontents[24m is processed.  Any emboldening,  constant  spacing,  or
              track  kerning is applied to this object as a whole, not to each
              character in [4mcontents[24m.

              An object defined by this request can be used just like a  glyph
              provided  by the output device.  In particular, other characters
              can be translated to it with the [1mtr [22mrequest; it can be made  the
              tab  or  leader  fill character with the [1mtc [22mand [1mlc [22mrequests; se‐
              quences of it can be drawn with the [1m\l [22mand [1m\L [22mescape  sequences;
              and,  if  the [1mhcode [22mrequest is used on [4mc[24m, it is subject to auto‐
              matic hyphenation.

              To prevent infinite recursion, occurrences of [4mc[24m within  its  own
              definition are treated normally (as if it were not being defined
              with [1mchar[22m).  The [1mtr [22mand [1mtrin [22mrequests take  precedence  if  [1mchar[0m
              both apply to [4mc[24m.  A character definition can be removed with the
              [1mrchar [22mrequest.

       [1m.chop [4m[22mobject[0m
              Remove the last character from the macro, string,  or  diversion
              [4mobject[24m.  This is useful for removing the newline from the end of
              a diversion that is to be interpolated as a  string.   This  re‐
              quest  can  be  used  repeatedly on the same [4mobject[24m; see section
              “gtroff Internals” in [4mGroff:[24m [4mThe[24m [4mGNU[24m  [4mImplementation[24m  [4mof[24m  [4mtroff[24m,
              the  [4mgroff[24m  Texinfo  manual, for discussion of nodes inserted by
              [4mgroff[24m.

       [1m.class [4m[22mname[24m [4mc1[24m [4mc2[24m ...
              Define a character class (or simply “class”) [4mname[24m comprising the
              characters or range expressions [4mc1[24m, [4mc2[24m, and so on.

              A  class thus defined can then be referred to in lieu of listing
              all the characters within it.  Currently, only  the  [1mcflags  [22mre‐
              quest can handle references to character classes.

              In  the request’s simplest form, each [4mcn[24m is a character (or spe‐
              cial character).
                     .class [quotes] ' \[aq] \[dq] \[oq] \[cq] \[lq] \[rq]

              Since class and special character  names  share  the  same  name
              space,  we recommend starting and ending the class name with “[1m[[22m”
              and “[1m][22m”, respectively, to avoid collisions with existing charac‐
              ter  names  defined  by [4mgroff[24m or the user (with [1mchar [22mand related
              requests).  This practice applies the presence  of  “[1m][22m”  in  the
              class  name to prevent the usage of the special character escape
              form “[1m\[[22m...[1m][22m”, thus you must use the [1m\C [22mescape to access a class
              with such a name.

              You  can  also  use a character range expression consisting of a
              start character followed by “[1m-[22m” and then an end character.   In‐
              ternally,  GNU  [4mtroff[24m converts these two character names to Uni‐
              code code points (according to  the  [4mgroff[24m  glyph  list  [GGL]),
              which  determine the start and end values of the range.  If that
              fails, the class definition is  skipped.   Furthermore,  classes
              can be nested.
                     .class [prepunct] , : ; > }
                     .class [prepunctx] \C'[prepunct]' \[u2013]-\[u2016]
              The  class “[1m[prepunctx][22m” thus contains the contents of the class
              “[1m[prepunct][22m” and characters in the range U+2013–U+2016.

              If you want to include “[1m-[22m” in a class,  it  must  be  the  first
              character  value  in the argument list, otherwise it gets misin‐
              terpreted as part of the range syntax.

              It is not possible to use class names as end points of range de‐
              finitions.

              A  typical  use of the [1mclass [22mrequest is to control line‐breaking
              and hyphenation rules as defined by the [1mcflags [22mrequest.  For ex‐
              ample, to inhibit line breaks before the characters belonging to
              the “[1m[prepunctx][22m” class defined in the previous example, you can
              write the following.
                     .cflags 2 \C'[prepunctx]'

       [1m.close [4m[22mstream[0m

              Define a color named [4mident.[24m  [4mscheme[24m identifies a color space and
              determines  the  number of required [4mcolor‐component[24ms; it must be
              one of  “[1mrgb[22m”  (three  components),  “[1mcmy[22m”  (three  components),
              “[1mcmyk[22m”  (four components), or “[1mgray[22m” (one component).  “[1mgrey[22m” is
              accepted as a synonym of “[1mgray[22m”.  The color  components  can  be
              encoded  as a hexadecimal value starting with [1m# [22mor [1m##[22m.  The for‐
              mer indicates that each component is in the range 0–255  (0–FF),
              the  latter  the  range  0–65535  (0–FFFF).  Alternatively, each
              color component can be specified as a decimal  fraction  in  the
              range  0–1,  interpreted  using  a  default scaling unit of “[1mf[22m”,
              which multiplies its value by 65,536 (but clamps it at 65,535).

              Each output device has a color named “[1mdefault[22m”, which cannot  be
              redefined.   A  device’s  default stroke and fill colors are not
              necessarily the same.

              terns contain only lowercase letters which should be applied re‐
              gardless of case.  In other words, they assume  that  the  words
              “ABBOT”  and “Abbot” should be hyphenated exactly as “abbot” is.
              [1mhcode [22mextends this principle to letters outside the Unicode  ba‐
              sic  Latin  alphabet;  without it, words containing such letters
              won’t be hyphenated properly even if the  corresponding  hyphen‐
              ation patterns contain them.

       [1m.hla [4m[22mlang[0m
              Set  the  hyphenation  language to [4mlang[24m.  Hyphenation exceptions
              specified with the [1mhw [22mrequest and hyphenation patterns  and  ex‐
              ceptions specified with the [1mhpf [22mand [1mhpfa [22mrequests are associated
              with the hyphenation language.  The [1mhla [22mrequest is  usually  in‐
              voked  by  a  localization  file, which is in turn loaded by the
              [4mtroffrc[24m or [4mtroffrc-end[24m file; see the [1mhpf [22mrequest below.  The hy‐
              phenation language is associated with the environment.

       [1m.hlm [22m[[4mn[24m]
              Set the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines to [4mn[24m.  If
              [4mn[24m is negative, there is no maximum.  If omitted, [4mn[24m is -1.   This
              value  is  associated  with  the environment.  Only lines output
              from a given environment count towards  the  maximum  associated
              with  that  environment.  Hyphens resulting from [1m\% [22mare counted;
              explicit hyphens are not.

       [1m.hpf [4m[22mpattern‐file[0m
              Read hyphenation  patterns  from  [4mpattern‐file[24m.   This  file  is
              sought in the same way that macro files are with the [1mmso [22mrequest
              or the [1m-m[4m[22mname[24m command‐line option to [4mgroff[24m(1) and [4mtroff[24m(1).

              The [4mpattern‐file[24m should have the same  format  as  (simple)  TeX
              pattern files.  The following scanning rules are implemented.

              • A  percent  sign  starts a comment (up to the end of the line)
                even if preceded by a backslash.

              • “Digraphs” like [1m\$ [22mare not supported.

              • “[1m^^[4m[22mxx[24m” (where each [4mx[24m is 0–9 or a–f) and [1m^^[4m[22mc[24m  (character  [4mc[24m  in
                the code point range 0–127 decimal) are recognized; other uses
                of [1m^ [22mcause an error.

              • No macro expansion is performed.

              • [1mhpf [22mchecks for the expression  [1m\patterns{[22m...[1m}  [22m(possibly  with
                whitespace  before  or  after the braces).  Everything between
                the braces is taken as  hyphenation  patterns.   Consequently,
                “[1m{[22m” and “[1m}[22m” are not allowed in patterns.

              • Similarly,  [1m\hyphenation{[22m...[1m}  [22mgives a list of hyphenation ex‐
                ceptions.

              • [1m\endinput [22mis recognized also.

              • For backwards compatibility,  if  [1m\patterns  [22mis  missing,  the
                whole  file  is treated as a list of hyphenation patterns (but
                the “[1m%[22m” character is still recognized as the start of  a  com‐
                ment).

              Use  the [1mhpfcode [22mrequest (see below) to map the encoding used in
              hyphenation pattern files to [4mgroff[24m’s input encoding.

              The set of hyphenation patterns is associated with  the  hyphen‐
              ation  language set by the [1mhla [22mrequest.  The [1mhpf [22mrequest is usu‐
              ally invoked by a localization file loaded by the [4mtroffrc[24m  file.
              By  default,  [4mtroffrc[24m  loads  the localization file for English.
              (As of [4mgroff[24m 1.23.0, localization files for Czech  ([4mcs[24m),  German
              ([4mde[24m),  English  ([4men[24m),  French ([4mfr[24m), Japanese ([4mja[24m), Swedish ([4msv[24m),
              and Chinese ([4mzh[24m) exist.)  For Western languages,  the  localiza‐
              tion  file  sets the hyphenation mode and loads hyphenation pat‐
              terns and exceptions.

              A second call to [1mhpf [22m(for the same language)  replaces  the  old
              patterns with the new ones.

              Invoking  [1mhpf  [22mcauses  an  error if there is no hyphenation lan‐
              guage.

              If no [1mhpf [22mrequest is specified (either in  the  document,  in  a
              file  loaded at startup, or in a macro package), GNU [4mtroff[24m won’t
              automatically hyphenate at all.

       [1m.hpfa [4m[22mpattern‐file[0m
              As [1mhpf[22m, except that the hyphenation patterns and exceptions from
              [4mpattern‐file[24m are appended to the patterns already applied to the
              hyphenation language of the environment.

       [1m.hpfcode [4m[22ma[24m [4mb[24m [[4mc[24m [4md[24m] ...

              This  is  an older mechanism no longer used by [4mgroff[24m’s own macro
              files; for its successor, see [1mhcode [22mabove.  [1mhpf  [22mor  [1mhpfa  [22mapply
              the  mapping  after  reading  or appending to the active list of
              patterns.  Its arguments are pairs of  character  codes—integers
              from  0  to  255.   The request maps character code [4ma[24m to code [4mb[24m,
              code [4mc[24m to code [4md[24m, and so on.  Character codes that would  other‐
              wise  be  invalid  in [4mgroff[24m can be used.  By default, every code
              maps to itself except those for letters “A” to “Z”, which map to
              those for “a” to “z”.

       [1m.hym [22m[[4mlength[24m]
              Set the (right) hyphenation margin to [4mlength[24m.  If the adjustment
              mode is not “[1mb[22m” or “[1mn[22m”, the line is  not  hyphenated  if  it  is
              shorter  than  [4mlength[24m.  Without an argument, the default hyphen‐
              ation margin is reset to its  default  value,  0.   The  default
              scaling  unit is “[1mm[22m”.  The hyphenation margin is associated with
              the environment.  A negative  argument  resets  the  hyphenation
              margin to zero, emitting a warning in category “[1mrange[22m”.

       [1m.hys [22m[[4mhyphenation‐space[24m]
              Suppress hyphenation of the line in adjustment modes “[1mb[22m” or “[1mn[22m”,
              if it can be justified by adding no more than  [4mhyphenation‐space[0m
              extra  space to each inter‐word space.  Without an argument, the
              hyphenation space adjustment threshold is  set  to  its  default
              value,  0.   The  default  scaling unit is “[1mm[22m”.  The hyphenation
              space adjustment threshold is associated with the current  envi‐
              ronment.   A  negative argument resets the hyphenation space ad‐
              justment threshold to  zero,  emitting  a  warning  in  category
              “[1mrange[22m”.

       [1m.itc [4m[22mn[24m [4mname[0m
              As  “[1mit[22m”,  but lines interrupted with the [1m\c [22mescape sequence are
              not applied to the line count.

       [1m.linetabs [4m[22mn[0m
              If  [4mn[24m  is  non‐zero or missing, enable line‐tabs mode, otherwise
              disable it (the default).  In this mode, tab stops are  computed
              relative to the start of the pending output line, instead of the
              drawing position corresponding to the start of the  input  line.
              Line‐tabs mode is a property of the environment.

              For example, the following

                     .ds x a\t\c
                     .ds y b\t\c
                     .ds z c
                     .ta 1i 3i
                     \*x
                     \*y
                     \*z
              yields
                     a         b         c
              whereas in line‐tabs mode, the same input gives
                     a         b                   c
              instead.

       [1m.lsm [22m[[4mname[24m]
              Set  the leading space macro (trap) to [4mname[24m.  If there are lead‐
              ing space characters on an input line, [4mname[24m is invoked  in  lieu
              of the usual [4mroff[24m behavior; the leading spaces are removed.  The
              count of leading spaces on an input line is stored  in  [1m\n[lsn][22m,
              and  the  amount  of corresponding horizontal motion in [1m\n[lss][22m,
              irrespective of whether a leading space trap is  set.   When  it
              is,  the  leading spaces are removed from the input line, and no
              motion is produced before calling [4mname[24m.  If no argument is  sup‐
              plied, the default leading space behavior is (re‐)established.

              are  (the “tmac path”).  If the file name to be interpolated has

              [1mtmac.[4m[22mname[24m  instead  and  vice  versa.  If [4mfile[24m does not exist, a
              warning in category “[1mfile[22m” is emitted and  the  request  has  no
              other effect.

              Unlike  “[1mif[22m”, it cannot govern conditional blocks.  Its applica‐
              tion is to maintain consistent indentation within macro  defini‐

              Define global fallback character [4mc[24m as [4mcontents[24m.  See  [1mchar[22m;  the
              distinction  is  that  a character defined with [1mschar [22mis located
              after the list of fonts declared with the  [1mspecial  [22mrequest  but
              before any mounted special fonts.

       [1m.shc [22m[[4mc[24m]
              Set  the  soft hyphen character, inserted when a word is hyphen‐
              ated automatically or at a hyphenation character, to [4mc[24m.  If [4mc[24m is
              omitted, the soft hyphen character is set to the default, [1m\[hy][22m.
              If the selected glyph does not exist in the font in use at a po‐
              tential  hyphenation  point, then the line is not broken at that
              point.  Neither character definitions  ([1mchar  [22mand  similar)  nor
              translations  ([1mtr [22mand similar) are considered when assigning the
              soft hyphen character.

       [1m.shift [4m[22mn[0m

              comes  argument  [4mi[24m-[4mn[24m;  arguments 1 to [4mn[24m are no longer available.
              If [4mn[24m is missing, arguments are shifted by 1.  No  effect  other‐

              Set  the  available  type sizes to [4ms1[24m, [4ms2[24m, ... [4msn[24m scaled points.
              The list of sizes can be terminated by an optional “[1m0[22m”.  Each [4msi[0m
              can  also be a range [4mm[24m–[4mn[24m.  In contrast to the device description
              file directive of the same name (see [4mgroff_font[24m(5)),  the  argu‐
              ment list can’t extend over more than one line.

       [1m.soquiet [4m[22mfile[0m

       [1m.special [4m[22mf[24m ...
              Declare  each  font  [4mf[24m  as  special, searching it for glyphs not
              found in the selected font.  Without  arguments,  this  list  of
              special fonts is made empty.

       [1m.spreadwarn [22m[[4mlimit[24m]
              Emit  a  [1mbreak [22mwarning if the additional space inserted for each
              space between words in an output line adjusted to  both  margins
              with “[1m.ad b[22m” is larger than or equal to [4mlimit[24m.  A negative value
              is treated as zero; an absent argument toggles  the  warning  on
              and  off without changing [4mlimit[24m.  The default scaling unit is [1mm[22m.
              At startup, [1mspreadwarn [22mis inactive and [4mlimit[24m is 3 m.

              For example, “[1m.spreadwarn 0.2m[22m” causes a warning if [1mbreak  [22mwarn‐
              ings  are  not  suppressed  and [4mtroff[24m must add 0.2 m or more for
              each inter‐word space in a line.

              its  lowercase ([1mdown[22m) or uppercase ([1mup[22m) version (if one exists).
              Special characters (see [4mgroff_char[24m(7)) will often  transform  in
              the  expected  way  due to the regular naming convention for ac‐
              cented characters.  When they  do  not,  use  substrings  and/or
              catenation.

              to the largest valid value (the string length minus one).  Nega‐
              tive  indices  count  backwards  from the end of the string: the

       [1m.trf [4m[22mfile[0m
              Transparently output the contents of file [4mfile[24m.   Each  line  is
              output  as if preceded by [1m\![22m; however, the lines are not subject
              to copy‐mode interpretation.  If the file does not  end  with  a
              newline,  then  a newline is added.  Unlike [1mcf[22m, [4mfile[24m cannot con‐
              tain characters that are invalid as input to GNU [4mtroff[24m.

              For example, you can define a macro [4mx[24m containing the contents of
              file [4mf[24m, using

                     .di x
                     .trf f
                     .di

       [1m.trin [4m[22mabcd[0m
              This  is  the same as the [1mtr [22mrequest except that the [1masciify [22mre‐
              quest uses the character code  (if  any)  before  the  character
              translation.  Example:

                     .trin ax
                     .di xxx
                     a

                     .asciify xxx
                     .xxx

              The result is “x a”.  Using [1mtr[22m, the result would be “x x”.

       [1m.trnt [4m[22mabcd[0m
              This  is the same as the [1mtr [22mrequest except that the translations
              do not apply to text that is transparently throughput into a di‐
              version with [1m\![22m.  For example,

                     .tr ab

                     \!.tm a

              only  tabs  and spaces between words, the latter usually arising
              from spaces or newlines in the input.  Tabs are treated as input
              tokens,  and spaces become adjustable again.  The vertical sizes
              of lines are not preserved, but glyph  information  (font,  type
              size, space width, and so on) is retained.

              those set by the [1mch[22m, [1mwh[22m, and [1mdt [22mrequests.

       [1m.warn [22m[[4mn[24m]
              Select  the  categories, or “types”, of reported warnings.  [4mn[24m is
              the sum of the numeric codes associated with each warning  cate‐
              gory  that  is to be enabled; all other categories are disabled.
              The categories and their associated codes are listed in  section
              “Warnings”  of  [4mtroff[24m(1).   For  example, “[1m.warn 0[22m” disables all
              warnings, and “[1m.warn 1[22m” disables all warnings except those about
              missing glyphs.  If no argument is given, all warning categories
              are enabled.

       [1m.warnscale [4m[22msi[0m
              Set the scaling unit used in warnings to [4msi[24m.  Valid  values  for
              [4msi[24m are [1mu[22m, [1mi [22m(the default), [1mc[22m, [1mp[22m, and [1mP[22m.

       [1m.while [4m[22mcond‐expr[24m [4manything[0m
              Evaluate  the  conditional  expression [4mcond‐expr[24m, and repeatedly
              execute [4manything[24m unless and  until  [4mcond‐expr[24m  evaluates  false.
              [4manything,[24m  which is often a conditional block, is referred to as
              the [1mwhile [22mrequest’s [4mbody.[0m

              [4mtroff[24m treats the body of a [1mwhile [22mrequest similarly to that of  a
              [1mde [22mrequest (albeit one not read in copy mode), but stores it un‐
              der an internal name and deletes it when the loop finishes.  The
              operation of a macro containing a [1mwhile [22mrequest can slow signif‐
              icantly if the [1mwhile [22mbody is large.  Each time the macro is exe‐
              cuted, the [1mwhile [22mbody is parsed and stored again.  An often bet‐
              ter solution—and one that is more  portable,  since  AT&T  [4mtroff[0m
              lacked  the [1mwhile [22mrequest—is to instead write a recursive macro.
              It will be parsed only once (unless you redefine it).   To  pre‐
              vent  infinite  loops, the default number of available recursion
              levels is 1,000 or somewhat  less  (because  things  other  than
              macro  calls  can  be on the input stack).  You can disable this
              protective measure, or raise the limit, by  setting  the  [1mslimit[0m
              register.  See section “Debugging” below.

              If  a  [1mwhile  [22mbody  begins with a conditional block, its closing
              brace must end an input line.

              The [1mbreak [22mand [1mcontinue [22mrequests alter a  [1mwhile  [22mloop’s  flow  of
              control.

                   of requests.  Using this register outside of a macro defin‐

   [1mMiscellaneous[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m predefines one string, [1m.T[22m, containing the argument  given  to
       the  [1m-T [22mcommand‐line option, namely the output device (for example, [1mpdf[0m
       or [1mutf8[22m).  The (read‐only) [4mregister[24m [1m.T [22minterpolates 1 if GNU  [4mtroff[24m  is
       run with the [1m-T [22mcommand‐line option, and 0 otherwise.

       A font not listed in the output device’s [4mDESC[24m file’s [1mfonts [22mdirective is
       automatically mounted at the next available font position  when  it  is
       selected.   If  you  mount  a  font explicitly with the [1mfp [22mrequest, you
       should do so on the first unused position, which can be  found  in  the
       [1m.fp [22mregister.

       Unparameterized  string interpolation does not conceal the arguments to
       a macro being interpreted.  Thus, in a macro definition,  the  call  of
       another macro with the existing argument list,
              [1m.[4m[22mxx[24m [1m\\$@[0m
       is more efficiently done with
              [1m\\*[[4m[22mxx[24m[1m]\\[0m
       (that is, with string interpolation).  The trailing backslashes prevent
       the final newline in the macro definition from being interpolated,  po‐
       tentially  putting  an  unwanted blank line on the output.  See section
       “Punning Names” in [4mgroff[24m(7).

       If a font  description  file  contains  pairwise  kerning  information,
       glyphs  from  that  font are kerned.  Kerning between two glyphs can be
       inhibited by placing a dummy character [1m\& [22mbetween them.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m keeps track of the nesting depth of escape sequence  interpo‐
       lations and other uses of delimiters, as in the [1mtl [22mrequest and the out‐
       put comparison operator (that is, input like [1m'foo'bar' [22mas a conditional
       expression),  so  the only characters you need to avoid using as delim‐
       iters are those that appear in the arguments you input,  not  any  that
       result from interpolation.  Typically, [1m' [22mworks fine.  Use visible char‐
       acters as delimiters in GNU [4mtroff[24m, not “ASCII” controls like BEL  (Con‐
       trol+G).  The implementation of [1m\$@ [22mensures that the double quotes sur‐
       rounding an argument appear at an interpolation  depth  different  from
       that  of  the  arguments themselves.  Similarly, in bracket‐form escape
       sequences like [1m\f[ZCMI], [22ma right bracket [1m] [22mdoes not  end  the  sequence
       unless  it  occurs at the same interpolation depth as the opening [1m[[22m, so
       input like
              \f[\*[my‐family]\*[my‐style]]
       works as desired.  In compatibility mode, no attention is paid  to  the
       interpolation depth.

       In  GNU  [4mtroff[24m,  the  [1mtr  [22mrequest can map characters to the unbreakable
       space escape sequence [1m\~ [22mas a special case ([1mtr [22mnormally  operates  only
       on  [4mcharacters[24m).  This feature replaces the odd‐parity [1mtr [22mmapping trick
       used in AT&T [4mtroff[24m documents, where a character, often [1m~[22m,  was  “sacri‐
       ficed”  by  mapping  it  to “nothing”, drafting it into use as an unad‐
       justable, unbreakable space.  (This  feature  was  gratuitous  even  in
       early  AT&T [4mtroff,[24m which supported the [1m\[4m[22mspace[24m escape sequence by 1976.)
       Often, it makes more sense to use GNU [4mtroff[24m’s [1m\~  [22mescape  sequence  in‐
       stead,  which  has been adopted by every other active [4mtroff[24m implementa‐
       tion except that of Illumos,  as  well  as  by  the  non[4m‐troff[24m  [4mmandoc[24m.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m permits tabs and spaces after the first dot on a control line
       that ends a macro definition.

[1mFormatter output[0m
       The page description language output by GNU [4mtroff[24m is modeled after that
       used  by  AT&T  [4mtroff[24m  once the latter adopted a device‐independent ap‐
       proach in the early 1980s.  Only the differences are  documented  here.
       For a fuller discussion, see [4mgroff_out[24m(5).

       Glyph  and font names can be of arbitrary length; postprocessors should
       not assume that they are at most two characters.  A glyph to be format‐
       ted  is always drawn from the current font; in contrast to AT&T device‐
       independent [4mtroff[24m, drivers need not search  special  fonts  to  find  a
       glyph.

              matter  to generate an even number of arguments).  Each glyph is
              set at the current drawing position, and the  position  is  then
              advanced  horizontally by the glyph’s width.  A glyph’s width is
              read from its metrics in the font description  file,  scaled  to
              the current type size, and rounded to a multiple of the horizon‐
              tal motion quantum.  Use the [1mC [22mcommand to emplace glyphs of spe‐
              cial characters.

              must  be  an integer.  0 corresponds to white and 1000 to black.
              A grayscale ramp spans the two.  A value outside this range uses
              the  stroke  color as the fill color.  The fill color is opaque.
              Normally the default is black, but some drivers  may  provide  a
              way  of changing this.  [1mDf [22mis obsolete since 2002, superseded by

              ([4mdx[24m1,[4mdy[24m1).   The  drawing position is left at the last [4mspecified[0m
              vertex, but this may change in a future version  of  GNU  [4mtroff[24m.
              Heirloom  Doctools  [4mtroff[24m,  like  DWB [4mtroff[24m, by default does not
              close the polygon.  In its [4mgroff[24m  compatibility  mode,  Heirloom
              closes  the  polygon  but leaves the drawing position [4munchanged[24m—
              that is, at the polygon’s [4minitial[24m drawing position.

              At the moment, GNU [4mpic[24m uses this command only to generate trian‐
              gles and rectangles.

       [1mDt [4m[22mn[24m   Set the line thickness to [4mn[24m basic units.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m output dri‐
              vers use a thickness proportional to the type size; this is  the
              GNU [4mtroff[24m default.  A negative [4mn[24m requests this explicitly.  An [4mn[0m
              of zero selects the smallest available line thickness.

       A difficulty arises in how the drawing position should be changed after
       the  execution  of  these commands.  This has little importance to most
       users, since the output of GNU [4mgrn[24m and  [4mpic[24m  does  not  depend  on  it.
       Given a drawing command of the form [1mD[4m[22mz[24m [4mx[24m1[4my[24m1...[4mxnyn[24m, where [4mz[24m is not [1mc [22mor
       [1me[22m, AT&T [4mtroff[24m treats each [4mxi[24m as a horizontal motion, each [4myi[24m as a  ver‐
       tical  one, and therefore assumes that the width of the drawn object is
       [4min[24m=Σ1[4mxi[24m, and its height is [4min[24m=Σ1[4myi[24m.  (Verify its assumption about height by
       examining the [1mst [22mand [1msb [22mregisters after using such a drawing command in
       a [1m\w [22mescape sequence).  For the sake of compatibility, GNU  [4mtroff[24m  also
       follows  this  rule, even though it frustrates extensions to the [1mD [22mcom‐
       mand that set drawing parameters rather than rendering objects, produc‐
       ing  ugly  results in the case of [1mDt [22mand [1mDf[22m, or otherwise don’t parame‐
       terize objects as a series of vertices, as with GNU [4mtroff[24m’s filled  el‐
       lipse,   [1mDE[22m.   Thus  after  executing  a  [1mD  [22mcommand  of  the  form  [1mD[4m[22mz[0m
       [4mx[24m1[4my[24m1...[4mxnyn[24m, the drawing position should be increased by ([4min[24m=Σ1[4mxi[24m,[4min[24m=Σ1[4myi[24m).
       In  a  future release, GNU [4mtroff[24m and its output drivers may abandon the
       application of this assumption to drawing commands not explicitly spec‐
       ified in the AT&T “Troff User’s Manual”.

       Fill color selection is implemented with another set of extensions.

   [1mDevice control syntax extension[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m introduces a line continuation convention, permitting the ar‐
       gument to the [1mx X [22mcommand to contain newlines.  A newline in the  input
       is  transformed  to  the sequence “[4mnewline[24m[1m+[22m”.  When interpreting an [1mx X[0m
       command, a postprocessor should therefore be prepared for a  plus  sign
       after  a  newline; if it occurs, preserve the newline, discard the plus
       sign, and continue to collect the input into the argument of  the  [1mx  X[0m
       command.  A newline [4mnot[24m followed by a plus sign terminates the [1mx X [22mcom‐
       mand.  An application of this feature is the embedding of PostScript or
       PDF language command streams into [4mtroff[24m output.

       GNU  [4mtroff[24m guarantees that the first three output commands it emits are
       as follows.

              x T [4mdevice[0m
              x res [4mn[24m [4mh[24m [4mv[0m
              x init

[1mDebugging[0m
       In addition to AT&T [4mtroff[24m’s debugging features, GNU  [4mtroff[24m  emits  more
       error  diagnostics when syntactical or semantic nonsense is encountered
       and supports several warning categories; the output of these can be se‐
       lected  with  [1mwarn[22m.   Also  see the [1m-E[22m, [1m-w[22m, and [1m-W [22moptions of [4mtroff[24m(1).
       Backtraces can be automatically produced when errors or warnings  occur
       (the [1m-b [22moption of [4mtroff[24m(1)) or generated on demand ([1mbacktrace[22m).

       [4mgroff[24m also adds more flexible diagnostic output requests ([1mtmc [22mand [1mtm1[22m).
       More aspects of formatter state can  be  examined  with  requests  that
       write  lists  of  defined registers ([1mpnr[22m), environments ([1mpev[22m), and page
       location traps ([1mptr[22m) to the standard error stream.

[1mImplementation differences[0m
       GNU [4mtroff[24m’s features sometimes cause incompatibilities  with  documents
       written  assuming old implementations of [4mtroff[24m.  Some GNU extensions to
       [4mtroff[24m are supported by other implementations.

       When adjusting to both margins, AT&T  [4mtroff[24m  at  first  adjusts  spaces
       starting  from  the right; GNU [4mtroff[24m begins from the left.  Both imple‐
       mentations adjust spaces from opposite ends on alternating output lines
       to prevent “rivers” in the text.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m does not always hyphenate words as AT&T [4mtroff[24m does.  The AT&T
       implementation uses a set of hard‐coded rules specific to U.S. English,
       while  GNU  [4mtroff[24m  uses language‐specific hyphenation pattern files de‐
       rived from TeX.  In some versions of [4mtroff[24m there was limited  space  to
       store  hyphenation  exceptions (arguments to the [1mhw [22mrequest); GNU [4mtroff[0m
       has no such restriction.

       Long names may be GNU [4mtroff[24m’s most obvious innovation.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m  in‐
       terprets  “[1m.dsabcd[22m” as defining a string “[1mab[22m” with contents “[1mcd[22m”.  Nor‐
       mally, GNU [4mtroff[24m interprets this as a call of a macro  named  “[1mdsabcd[22m”.
       AT&T  [4mtroff[24m also interprets [1m\*[ [22mand [1m\n[ [22mas an interpolation of a string
       or register, respectively, called “[1m[[22m”.  In GNU [4mtroff[24m, however, the  “[1m[[22m”
       is  normally  interpreted  as beginning the enclosure of a long identi‐
       fier.  In compatibility mode, GNU [4mtroff[24m interprets names in the  tradi‐
       tional way, which means that they are limited to one or two characters.
       See the [1m-C [22moption in [4mtroff[24m(1) and, above, the [1m.C [22mand [1m.cp [22mregisters, and
       [1mcp [22mand “[1mdo[22m” requests, for more on compatibility mode.

       The  register [1m\n[.cp] [22mis specialized and may require a statement of ra‐
       tionale.  When writing macro packages or documents that use  GNU  [4mtroff[0m
       features  and  which may be mixed with other packages or documents that
       do not—common scenarios include serial processing of man pages  or  use
       of the “[1mso[22m” or [1mmso [22mrequests—you may desire correct operation regardless
       of compatibility mode enablement in the surrounding  context.   It  may
       occur  to you to save the existing value of [1m\n(.C [22minto a register, say,
       [1m_C[22m, at the beginning of your file, turn  compatibility  mode  off  with
       “[1m.cp   0[22m”,  then  restore  it  from  that  register  at  the  end  with
       “[1m.cp \n(_C[22m”.  At the same time, a modular design of a document or macro
       package  may  lead you to multiple layers of inclusion.  You cannot use
       the same register name everywhere lest you “clobber” the value  from  a
       preceding  or enclosing context.  The two‐character register name space
       of AT&T [4mtroff[24m is confining and mnemonically challenging; you  may  wish
       to use GNU [4mtroff[24m’s more capacious name space.  However, attempting “[1m.nr[0m
       [1m_my_saved_C \n(.C[22m” will not work in compatibility  mode;  the  register
       name  is  too long.  “This is exactly what [1m.do [22mis for,” you think, “[1m.do[0m
       [1mnr _my_saved_C \n(.C[22m”.  The foregoing will always  save  zero  to  your
       register, because “[1mdo[22m” turns compatibility mode [4moff[24m while it interprets
       its argument list.  What you need is:
              .do nr _my_saved_C \n[.cp]
              .cp 0
       at the beginning of your file, followed by
              .cp \n[_my_saved_C]
              .do rr _my_saved_C
       at the end.  As in the C language, we all have to share  one  big  name
       space, so choose a register name that is unlikely to collide with other
       uses.

       The existence of the [1m.T [22mstring is a common  feature  of  post‐CSTR  #54
       [4mtroff[24ms—DWB  3.3,  Solaris, Heirloom Doctools, and Plan 9 [4mtroff[24m all sup‐
       port it—but valid values are specific to each implementation.  The  be‐
       havior  of  the [1m.T [22mregister in GNU [4mtroff[24m differs from AT&T [4mtroff[24m, which
       interpolated 1 only if [4mnroff[24m was the formatter and was called with [1m-T[22m.

       The [1mlf [22mrequest sets the number of the [4mcurrent[24m input line in AT&T [4mtroff[24m,
       and the [4mnext[24m in GNU [4mtroff[24m.

       AT&T  [4mtroff[24m  had  only  environments  named  “[1m0[22m”, “[1m1[22m”, and “[1m2[22m”.  In GNU
       [4mtroff[24m, any number of environments may exist, using  any  valid  identi‐
       fiers for their names.

       GNU  [4mtroff[24m  normally  tracks the interpolation depth of escape sequence
       parameters and other delimited structures,  but  not  in  compatibility
       mode.  See section “Miscellaneous” above.

       In compatibility mode, the escape sequences [1m\f[22m, [1m\H[22m, [1m\m[22m, [1m\M[22m, [1m\R[22m, [1m\s[22m, and
       [1m\S [22mare transparent at the beginning of an input line for the purpose of
       recognizing  a  control  character, because they modify formatter state
       ([1m\R[22m) or properties of the environment (the rest) and therefore  do  not
       create  output  nodes.   For example, this code produces bold output in
       both cases, but the text differs,
              .de xx '
              Hello!
              ..
              \fB.xx\fP
       formatting “.xx” normally and “Hello!” in compatibility mode.

       GNU [4mtroff[24m request names unrecognized  by  other  [4mtroff[24m  implementations
       will  likely be ignored; escape sequences that are GNU [4mtroff[24m extensions
       are liable to format their function selector character.   For  example,
       the adjustable, non‐breaking space escape sequence [1m\~ [22mis also supported
       by Heirloom  Doctools  [4mtroff[24m  050915  (September  2005),  [4mmandoc[24m  1.9.5
       (2009‐09‐21),  [4mneatroff[24m (commit 1c6ab0f6e, 2016‐09‐13), and Plan 9 from
       User Space [4mtroff[24m  (commit  93f8143600,  2022‐08‐12),  but  not  by  So‐
       laris/Illumos [4mtroff[24ms, which will render it as [1m~[22m.

       GNU  [4mtroff[24m  does  not allow the use of the escape sequences [1m\|[22m, [1m\^[22m, [1m\&[22m,
       [1m\{[22m, [1m\}[22m, [1m\[4m[22mspace[24m, [1m\'[22m, [1m\`[22m, [1m\-[22m, [1m\_[22m, [1m\![22m, [1m\%[22m,  or  [1m\c  [22min  identifiers;  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m  does.  The [1m\A [22mescape sequence (see subsection “Escape sequences”
       above) may be helpful in avoiding their use.

       Normally, the syntax form [1m\s[4m[22mn[24m accepts only a single character (a digit)
       for  [4mn[24m,  consistently  with  other forms that originated in AT&T [4mtroff[24m,
       like [1m\*[22m, [1m\$[22m, [1m\f[22m, [1m\g[22m, [1m\k[22m, [1m\n[22m, and [1m\z[22m.  In  compatibility  mode  only,  a
       non‐zero  [4mn[24m  must  be in the range 4–39.  Legacy documents relying upon
       this quirk of parsing should be migrated to another  [1m\s  [22mform.   [Back‐
       ground:  The Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter (the original device
       target for AT&T [4mtroff[24m) supported only a few discrete type sizes in  the
       range 6–36 points, so Ossanna contrived a special case in the parser to
       do what the user must have meant.  Kernighan warned of this in the 1992
       revision  of CSTR #54 (§2.3), and more recently, McIlroy referred to it
       as a “living fossil”.]

       Fractional type sizes cause one noteworthy  incompatibility.   In  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m  the [1mps [22mrequest ignores scaling units and thus “[1m.ps 10u[22m” sets the
       type size to 10 points, whereas in GNU [4mtroff[24m it sets the type  size  to
       10 [4mscaled[24m points, which may be a much smaller measurement.  See subsec‐
       tion “Fractional type sizes and new scaling units” above.

       The [1mab [22mrequest differs from AT&T [4mtroff[24m: GNU [4mtroff[24m writes no message  to
       the  standard error stream if no arguments are given, and it exits with
       a failure status instead of a successful one.

       The [1mbp [22mrequest differs from AT&T [4mtroff[24m: GNU [4mtroff[24m  does  not  accept  a
       scaling  unit on the argument, a page number; the former (somewhat use‐
       lessly) does.

       In AT&T [4mtroff[24m the [1mpm [22mrequest reports macro, string, and diversion sizes
       in  units  of  128‐byte blocks, and an argument reduces the report to a
       sum of the above in the same units.  GNU [4mtroff[24m  ignores  any  arguments
       and reports the sizes in bytes.

       Unlike AT&T [4mtroff[24m, GNU [4mtroff[24m does not ignore the [1mss [22mrequest if the out‐
       put is a terminal device; instead, the values of minimum inter‐word and
       additional  inter‐sentence  space  are each rounded down to the nearest
       multiple of 12.

       In GNU [4mtroff[24m there is a fundamental  difference  between  (unformatted)
       characters and (formatted) glyphs.  Everything that affects how a glyph
       is output is stored with the glyph node; once a  glyph  node  has  been
       constructed,  it is unaffected by any subsequent requests that are exe‐
       cuted, including [1mbd[22m, [1mcs[22m, [1mtkf[22m, [1mtr[22m, or [1mfp [22mrequests.  Normally, glyphs are
       constructed from characters immediately before the glyph is added to an
       output line.  Macros, diversions, and strings are  all,  in  fact,  the
       same  type  of  object; they contain a sequence of intermixed character
       and glyph nodes.  Special characters transform from one to  the  other:
       before being added to the output, they behave as characters; afterward,
       they are glyphs.  A glyph node does not behave like  a  character  node
       when it is processed by a macro: it does not inherit any of the special
       properties that the character from which it was constructed might  have
       had.  For example, the input
              .di x
              \\\\
              .br
              .di
              .x
       produces “[1m\\[22m” in GNU [4mtroff[24m.  Each pair of backslashes becomes one back‐
       slash [4mglyph;[24m the resulting backslashes are thus not interpreted as  es‐
       cape  [4mcharacters[24m when they are reread as the diversion is output.  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m [4mwould[24m interpret them as escape characters when rereading them and
       end up printing one “[1m\[22m”.

       One  way  to format a backslash in most documents is with the [1m\e [22mescape
       sequence; this formats the glyph of the current escape  character,  re‐
       gardless  of  whether  it is used in a diversion; it also works in both
       GNU [4mtroff[24m and AT&T [4mtroff[24m.  (Naturally, if  you’ve  changed  the  escape
       character,  you  need  to prefix the “[1me[22m” with whatever it is—and you’ll
       likely get something other than a backslash in the output.)

       The other correct way, appropriate in contexts independent of the back‐
       slash’s  common use as a [4mroff[24m escape character—perhaps in discussion of
       character sets or other programming languages—is the  character  escape
       [1m\(rs  [22mor  [1m\[rs][22m,  for  “reverse  solidus”,  from its name in the ECMA‐6
       (ISO/IEC 646) standard.  [This escape sequence is not portable to  AT&T
       [4mtroff[24m,  but is to its lineal descendant, Heirloom Doctools [4mtroff[24m, as of
       its 060716 release (July 2006).]

       To store an escape sequence in a diversion that is interpreted when the
       diversion  is  reread, either use the traditional [1m\! [22mtransparent output
       facility, or, if this is unsuitable, the new [1m\? [22mescape  sequence.   See
       subsection  “Escape  sequences”  above  and  sections  “Diversions” and
       “gtroff Internals” in [4mGroff:[24m [4mThe[24m [4mGNU[24m [4mImplementation[24m [4mof[24m [4mtroff[24m, the [4mgroff[0m
       Texinfo manual.

       In the somewhat pathological case where a diversion exists containing a
       partially collected line and a partially collected  line  at  the  top‐
       level diversion has never existed, AT&T [4mtroff[24m will output the partially
       collected line at the end of input; GNU [4mtroff[24m will not.

   [1mFormatter output incompatibilities[0m
       Its extensions notwithstanding, the [4mgroff[24m  intermediate  output  format
       has some incompatibilities with that of AT&T [4mtroff[24m, but better compati‐
       bility is sought; problem reports and patches are welcome.  The follow‐
       ing incompatibilities are known.

       • The  drawing  position  after rendering polygons is inconsistent with
         AT&T [4mtroff[24m practice.  Other implementations  have  diverged  on  this
         point as well.

       • The output cannot be easily rescaled to other devices as AT&T [4mtroff[24m’s
         could.

[1mName[0m
       groff_hdtbl - Heidelberger table macros for GNU [4mroff[0m

[1mDescription[0m
       The [4mhdtbl[24m macros consist of four base and three optional  macros,  con‐
       trolled by about twenty arguments.  The syntax is simple and similar to
       the HTML table model and nearly as flexible: you can write sequences of
       tokens  (macro  calls with their arguments and content data), separated
       by blanks and beginning with a macro call, into the same  line  to  get
       compact and cleanly arrranged input.  An advantage of [4mhdtbl[24m is that the
       tables are constructed without calling a preprocessor; this means  that
       [4mgroff[24m(7)’s  full  macro capabilities are available.  On the other hand,
       table processing with [4mhdtbl[24m is much slower than using the  [4mtbl[24m(1)  pre‐
       processor.   A  further advantage is that the HTML‐like syntax of [4mhdtbl[0m
       will be easily converted to HTML; this is not implemented yet.

[1mUsage[0m
       In this and the next section, we present examples to help users  under‐
       stand  the  basic  workflow  of [4mhdtbl[24m.  First of all, you must load the
       [4mhdtbl.tmac[24m file.  As with nearly all other [4mgroff[24m macro packages,  there
       are two possibilities to do so: Either add the line

              .mso hdtbl.tmac

       to  your [4mroff[24m file before using any macros of the [4mhdtbl[24m package, or add
       the option

              -m hdtbl

       to the command line of groff (before the document file  which  contains
       [4mhdtbl[24m  macros).   Then  you can include on or more tables in your docu‐
       ment, where each one must be started and ended with the .TBL  and  .ETB
       macros, respectively.

       In this man page, we approximate the result of each example as terminal
       output to be as generic as possible since [4mhdtbl[24m currently only supports
       the [1mps [22mand [1mpdf [22moutput drivers.

       The  simplest  well‐formed  table  consists of just single calls to the
       four base table macros in the right order.  Here we construct  a  table
       with only one cell.

              .TBL
              .TR
              .TD
              [4mcontents[24m [4mof[24m [4mthe[24m [4mtable[24m [4mcell[0m
              .ETB

       A terminal representation is

              +------------------------------------------------------+
              | [4mcontents-of-the-table-cell[24m                           |
              +------------------------------------------------------+

       Equivalent to the above is the following notation.

              .TBL .TR .TD "[4mcontents[24m [4mof[24m [4mthe[24m [4mtable[24m [4mcell[24m" .ETB

       By  default,  the formatted table is inserted into the surrounding text
       at the place of its definition.  If the  vertical  space  isn’t  suffi‐
       cient,  it  is  placed at the top of the next page.  Tables can also be
       stored for later insertion.

       Using ‘[4mrow‐number[24m*[4mcolumn‐number[24m’ as the data for the table cells, a ta‐
       ble with two rows and two columns can be written as

              .TBL cols=2
              .  TR .TD 1*1 .TD 1*2
              .  TR .TD 2*1 .TD 2*2
              .ETB

       A terminal representation is

              +--------------------------+---------------------------+
              | 1*1                      | 1*2                       |
              +--------------------------+---------------------------+
              | 2*1                      | 2*2                       |
              +--------------------------+---------------------------+

       Here  we  see a difference from HTML tables: The number of columns must
       be explicitly specified using the ‘cols=[4mm[24m’ argument (or indirectly  via
       the ‘width’ argument, see below).

       The  contents  of a table cell is arbitrary; for example, it can be an‐
       other table, without restriction to the nesting depth.  A  given  table
       layout  can  be  either constructed with suitably nested tables or with
       proper arguments to .TD and .TH, controlling column and  row  spanning.
       Note, however, that this table

              .TBL
              .  TR
              .    TD
              .      nop 1*1 1*2
              .  TR
              .    TD
              .      TBL cols=2 border=
              .        TR
              .          TD
              .            nop 2*1
              .          TD
              .            nop 2*2
              .      ETB
              .ETB

       and this table

              .TBL cols=2
              .  TR
              .    TD colspan=2
              .      nop 1*1 1*2
              .  TR
              .    TD
              .      nop 2*1
              .    TD
              .      nop 2*2
              .ETB

       are  similar  but  not identical (the use of .nop is purely cosmetic to
       get proper indentation).

       The first table looks like

              +------------------------------------------------------+
              | 1*1 1*2                                              |
              +------------------------------------------------------+
              |                                                      |
              | 2*1                         2*2                      |
              |                                                      |
              +------------------------------------------------------+

       and the second one like

              +------------------------------------------------------+
              | 1*1 1*2                                              |
              +---------------------------+--------------------------+
              | 2*1                       | 2*2                      |
              +---------------------------+--------------------------+

       Here is the latter table in a more compact form.

              .TBL cols=2 .TR ".TD colspan=2" 1*1 1*2
              .            TR .TD 2*1 .TD 2*2 .ETB

       If a macro has one or more arguments (see below), and it is not  start‐
       ing  a line, everything belonging to this macro including the macro it‐
       self must be enclosed in double quotes.

[1mMacros and arguments[0m
       The order of macro calls and other tokens follows the HTML  model.   In
       the  following  list,  valid  predecessors  and successors of all [4mhdtbl[0m
       macros are given, together with the possible arguments.

       Macro arguments are separated by blanks.  The order of arguments is ar‐
       bitrary; they are of the form

              key=[4mvalue[0m

       or

              key='[4mvalue1[24m [[4mvalue2[24m [...]]'

       with  the  only  exception  of the optional argument of the macro .ETB,
       which is the string ‘hold’.  Another possible form is

              "key=[4mvalue1[24m [[4mvalue2[24m [...]]"

       However, this is limited to the case where the macro is the  first  one
       in the line and not already enclosed in double quotes.

       Argument  values specified below as [4mc[24m are colors predefined by [4mgroff[24m or
       colors defined by the user with the .defcolor request.   Argument  val‐
       ues [4md[24m are decimal numbers with or without decimal point.  Argument val‐
       ues [4mm[24m are natural numbers.  Argument values [4mn[24m are numerical values with
       the usual [4mgroff[24m scaling indicators.  Some of the arguments are specific
       to one or two macros, but most of them can be specified with .TBL, .TR,
       .TD, and .TH.  These common arguments are explained in the next subsec‐
       tion.

       Most of the argument default values can be changed by the user by  set‐
       ting corresponding default registers or strings, as listed below.

       low.  Setting an argument with the .TBL macro has the  same  effect  as
       setting  it  for all rows in the table.  Setting an argument with a .TR
       macro has the same effect as setting it for all the .TH or .TD macro in
       this row.

[4m[1mhdtbl[24m customization[0m
       Before creating the first table, you should configure default values to
       minimize  the  markup needed in each table.  The following example sets
       up defaults suitable for typical papers:

              .ds t*bgc white\" background color
              .ds t*fgc black\" foreground color
              .ds t*bc black\"  border color
              .nr t*cpd 0.1n\"  cell padding

       The  file  [4m/usr/share/doc/groff-1.23.0/examples/hdtbl/common.roff[24m  pro‐
       vides another example setup in the “minimal Page setup” section.

       A  table which does not fit on a partially filled page is printed auto‐
       matically on the top of the next page if you append the little  utility
       macro t*hm to the page header macro of your document’s main macro pack‐
       age.  For example, say

              .am pg@top
              .  t*hm
              ..

       if you use the [4mms[24m macro package.

       The macro t*EM checks for held or kept  tables,  and  for  missing  ETB
       macros (table not closed).  You can call this macro by appending it the
       to end‐of‐input macro of the main,  or  “full‐service”,  macro  package
       your document uses.  For example, try
              .am pg@end-text
              .  t*EM
              ..
       if you use the [4mms[24m package.

       breadth of the [4mgroff[24m typesetting system.

       We  discuss  other macros ([1m.AT[22m, [1m.DT[22m, [1m.HP[22m, [1m.OP[22m, [1m.PD[22m, and [1m.UC[22m) in subsec‐
       tion “Deprecated features” below.

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to simply  as
       a  “man  page”, regardless of its length, without gendered implication,
       and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.

   [1mMacro reference preliminaries[0m
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled pairs  to‐
       gether, as with [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.

       An  empty  macro argument can be specified with a pair of double‐quotes
       (""), but the [4mman[24m package is designed such that this should  seldom  be
       necessary.   Most macro arguments will be formatted as text in the out‐
       put; exceptions are noted.

   [1mDocument structure macros[0m
       Document structure macros organize a man page’s content.  All  of  them
       break  the output line.  [1m.TH [22m(title heading) identifies the document as
       a man page and configures the page headers and footers.  Section  head‐
       ings ([1m.SH[22m), one of which is mandatory and many of which are convention‐
       ally expected, facilitate location of material by the  reader  and  aid
       the  man  page  writer  to  discuss all essential aspects of the topic.
       Subsection headings ([1m.SS[22m) are optional and permit  sections  that  grow
       long  to develop in a controlled way.  Many technical discussions bene‐
       fit from examples; lengthy ones, especially those  reflecting  multiple
       lines  of input to or output from the system, are usefully bracketed by
       [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.  When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand, use
       [1m.RS[22m/[1m.RE [22mto inset a region within a (sub)section.

       [1m.TH [4m[22mtopic[24m [4msection[24m [[4mfooter‐middle[24m] [[4mfooter‐inside[24m] [[4mheader‐middle[24m]
              Determine  the contents of the page header and footer.  The sub‐
              ject of the man page is [4mtopic[24m and the section of the  manual  to
              which  it  belongs  is  [4msection.[24m  See [4mman[24m(1) or [4mintro[24m(1) for the
              manual sectioning applicable to your system.  [4mtopic[24m and  [4msection[0m
              are  positioned  together  at  the  left and right in the header
              (with [4msection[24m in parentheses  immediately  appended  to  [4mtopic[24m).
              [4mfooter‐middle[24m is centered in the footer.  The arrangement of the
              rest of the footer depends on whether double‐sided layout is en‐
              abled  with  the  option  [1m-rD1[22m.   When  disabled  (the default),
              [4mfooter‐inside[24m is positioned  at  the  bottom  left.   Otherwise,
              [4mfooter‐inside[24m appears at the bottom left on recto (odd‐numbered)
              pages, and at the bottom right on verso  (even‐numbered)  pages.
              The outside footer is the page number, except in the continuous‐
              rendering mode enabled by the option [1m-rcR=1[22m, in which case it is
              the  [4mtopic[24m and [4msection,[24m as in the header.  [4mheader‐middle[24m is cen‐
              tered in the header.  If [4msection[24m is an integer between 1  and  9
              (inclusive),  there is no need to specify [4mheader‐middle;[24m [4man.tmac[0m
              will supply text for it.  The macro package may also  abbreviate
              [4mtopic[24m  and [4mfooter‐inside[24m with ellipses if they would overrun the
              space available in the header  and  footer,  respectively.   For
              HTML output, headers and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally,  this  macro breaks the page, resetting the number
              to 1 (unless the [1m-rC1 [22moption is given).   This  feature  is  in‐
              tended only for formatting multiple [4mman[24m documents in sequence.

              A valid [4mman[24m document calls [1m.TH [22monce, early in the file, prior to
              any other macro calls.

       [1m.SH [22m[[4mheading‐text[24m]
              Set [4mheading‐text[24m as a section heading.  If no argument is given,
              a  one‐line input trap is planted; text on the next line becomes
              [4mheading‐text.[24m  The left margin is reset to zero to set the head‐
              ing  text in bold (or the font specified by the string [1mHF[22m), and,
              on typesetting devices, slightly larger than the base type size.
              If  the  heading  font [1m\*[HF] [22mis bold, use of an italic style in
              [4mheading‐text[24m is mapped to the bold‐italic style if available  in
              the  font  family.   The  inset level is reset to 1, setting the
              left margin to the value of the [1mIN [22mregister.  Text  after  [4mhead‐[0m
              [4ming‐text[24m is set as an ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m).

              The  content  of [4mheading‐text[24m and ordering of sections follows a
              set of common practices, as has much of the layout  of  material
              within sections.  For example, a section called “Name” or “NAME”
              must exist, must be the first section after the  [1m.TH  [22mcall,  and
              must contain only text of the form
                     [4mtopic[24m[[1m, [4m[22manother‐topic[24m]... \- [4msummary‐description[0m
              for  a  man page to be properly indexed.  See [4mgroff_man_style[24m(7)
              for suggestions and [4mman[24m(7) for  the  conventions  prevailing  on
              your system.

       [1m.SS [22m[[4msubheading‐text[24m]
              Set  [4msubheading‐text[24m  as a subsection heading indented between a
              section heading and an ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m).  If no  argument
              is  given,  a  one‐line  input trap is planted; text on the next
              line becomes [4msubheading‐text.[24m  The left margin is reset  to  the
              value of the [1mSN [22mregister to set the heading text in bold (or the
              font specified by the string [1mHF[22m).  If the heading font [1m\*[HF] [22mis
              bold, use of an italic style in [4msubheading‐text[24m is mapped to the
              bold‐italic style if available in the font  family.   The  inset
              level is reset to 1, setting the left margin to the value of the
              [1mIN [22mregister.  Text after [4msubheading‐text[24m is set as  an  ordinary
              paragraph ([1m.P[22m).

       [1m.EX[0m
       [1m.EE    [22mBegin  and  end  example.   After [1m.EX[22m, filling is disabled and a
              constant‐width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling  [1m.EE  [22men‐
              ables filling and restores the previous font.

              These macros are extensions introduced in Ninth Edition Research
              Unix.  Systems running that [4mtroff[24m, or  those  from  Documenter’s
              Workbench,  Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 [4mtroff[24m support them.  To
              be certain your page will be portable to systems  that  do  not,
              copy  their definitions from the [4man-ext.tmac[24m file of a [4mgroff[24m in‐
              stallation.

       [1m.RS [22m[[4minset‐amount[24m]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The position of the left mar‐
              gin  is  saved,  then moved right by [4minset‐amount,[24m if specified,
              and by the amount of the [1mIN [22mregister otherwise.   Calls  to  [1m.RS[0m
              can be nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by [1m.RE[22m.
              The level prior to any [1m.RS [22mcalls is 1.

       [1m.RE [22m[[4mlevel[24m]
              End a relative inset.  The left margin  corresponding  to  inset
              level  [4mlevel[24m  is  restored.   If no argument is given, the inset
              level is reduced by 1.

   [1mParagraphing macros[0m
       An ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m) is set without a first‐line  indentation  at
       the  current left margin.  In man pages and other technical literature,
       definition lists are  frequently  encountered;  these  can  be  set  as
       “tagged  paragraphs”,  which  have one ([1m.TP[22m) or more ([1m.TQ[22m) leading tags
       followed by a paragraph that has an additional  indentation.   The  in‐
       dented paragraph ([1m.IP[22m) macro is useful to continue the indented content
       of a narrative started with [1m.TP[22m, or to present an itemized  or  ordered
       list.  All of these macros break the output line.  If another paragraph
       macro has occurred since the previous [1m.SH [22mor [1m.SS[22m, they (except for [1m.TQ[22m)
       follow  the break with a default amount of vertical space, which can be
       changed by the deprecated [1m.PD [22mmacro;  see  subsection  “Horizontal  and
       vertical  spacing” below.  They also reset the type size and font style
       to defaults ([1m.TQ [22magain excepted); see subsection  “Font  style  macros”
       below.

       [1m.P[0m
       [1m.LP[0m
       [1m.PP    [22mBegin  a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  The inden‐
              tation is reset to the default value; the left  margin,  as  af‐
              fected by [1m.RS [22mand [1m.RE[22m, is not.

       [1m.TP [22m[[4mindentation[24m]
              Set  a  paragraph  with  a leading tag, and the remainder of the
              paragraph indented.  A one‐line input trap is planted;  text  on
              the  next line, which can be formatted with a macro, becomes the
              tag, which is placed at the current left margin.  The tag can be
              extended  with  the  [1m\c [22mescape sequence.  Subsequent text is in‐
              dented by [4mindentation,[24m if specified, and by the amount of the [1mIN[0m
              register  otherwise.   If the tag is not as wide as the indenta‐
              tion, the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,  at  the
              applicable  indentation,  and  continues on the following lines.
              Otherwise, the descriptive part of the paragraph begins  on  the
              line following the tag.

       [1m.TQ    [22mSet an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with [1m.TP[22m.  An input
              trap is planted as with [1m.TP[22m.

              This macro is a GNU extension not  defined  on  systems  running
              AT&T,  Plan  9,  or  Solaris  [4mtroff[24m;  see [4man-ext.tmac[24m in section
              “Files” below.

       [1m.IP [22m[[4mtag[24m] [[4mindentation[24m]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional tag.  The [4mtag[24m and [4min‐[0m
              [4mdentation[24m  arguments,  if present, are handled as with [1m.TP[22m, with
              the exception that the [4mtag[24m argument  to  [1m.IP  [22mcannot  include  a
              macro call.

   [1mCommand synopsis macros[0m
       [1m.SY  [22mand [1m.YS [22maid you to construct a command synopsis that has the clas‐
       sical Unix appearance.  They break the output line.

       These macros are GNU extensions not defined on  systems  running  AT&T,
       Plan 9, or Solaris [4mtroff[24m; see [4man-ext.tmac[24m in section “Files” below.

       [1m.SY [4m[22mcommand[0m
              Begin  synopsis.   A new paragraph begins at the left margin un‐
              less [1m.SY [22mhas already been called without a corresponding [1m.YS[22m, in
              which  case only a break is performed.  Adjustment and automatic
              hyphenation are disabled.  [4mcommand[24m is set in bold.  If  a  break
              is  required, lines after the first are indented by the width of
              [4mcommand[24m plus a space.

       [1m.YS    [22mEnd synopsis.  Indentation, adjustment, and hyphenation are  re‐
              stored to their previous states.

   [1mHyperlink macros[0m
       Man page cross references are best presented with [1m.MR[22m.  Text may be hy‐
       perlinked to email addresses with [1m.MT[22m/[1m.ME [22mor other URIs  with  [1m.UR[22m/[1m.UE[22m.
       Hyperlinked text is supported on HTML and terminal output devices; ter‐
       minals and pager programs must support ECMA‐48 OSC 8  escape  sequences
       (see  [4mgrotty[24m(1)).   When device support is unavailable or disabled with
       the [1mU [22mregister (see section “Options” below), [1m.MT [22mand [1m.UR [22mURIs are ren‐
       dered between angle brackets after the linked text.

       The  arguments  to [1m.MR[22m, [1m.MT[22m, and [1m.UR [22mshould be prepared for typesetting
       since they can appear in the output.  Use special character escape  se‐
       quences  to encode Unicode basic Latin characters where necessary, par‐
       ticularly the hyphen‐minus.  The formatter removes [1m\: [22mescape  sequences
       from  hyperlinks  when supplying device control commands to output dri‐
       vers.

   [1mFont style macros[0m
       The  [4mman[24m macro package is limited in its font styling options, offering
       only [1mbold [22m([1m.B[22m), [4mitalic[24m ([1m.I[22m), and roman.  Italic text is usually set un‐
       derscored instead on terminal devices.  The [1m.SM [22mand [1m.SB [22mmacros set text
       in roman or bold, respectively, at a smaller type  size;  these  differ
       visually  from regular‐sized roman or bold text only on typesetting de‐
       vices.  It is often necessary to set text in different  styles  without
       intervening  space.  The macros [1m.BI[22m, [1m.BR[22m, [1m.IB[22m, [1m.IR[22m, [1m.RB[22m, and [1m.RI[22m, where
       “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate bold, italic, and roman,  respectively,  set
       their  odd‐  and even‐numbered arguments in alternating styles, with no
       space separating them.

       The default type size and family for typesetting  devices  is  10‐point
       Times,  except on the [1mX75-12 [22mand [1mX100-12 [22mdevices where the type size is
       12 points.  The default style is roman.

       [1m.B [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set [4mtext[24m in bold.  If no argument is  given,  a  one‐line  input
              trap  is  planted;  text  on the next line, which can be further
              formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

       [1m.I [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set [4mtext[24m in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is given,
              a  one‐line  input trap is planted; text on the next line, which
              can be further formatted with a macro, is set in  an  italic  or
              oblique face.

       [1m.SM [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set  [4mtext[24m  one point smaller than the default type size on type‐
              setting devices.  If no argument is given, a one‐line input trap
              is  planted; text on the next line, which can be further format‐
              ted with a macro, is set smaller.

       [1m.SB [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set [4mtext[24m in bold and (on typesetting devices) one point  smaller
              than the default type size.  If no argument is given, a one‐line
              input trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be  fur‐
              ther  formatted  with a macro, is set smaller and in bold.  This
              macro is an extension introduced in SunOS 4.0.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style  alternation  macros
       below  set no input traps; they must be given arguments to have effect.
       Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.

   [1mHorizontal and vertical spacing[0m
       The [4mindentation[24m argument accepted by [1m.IP[22m, [1m.TP[22m, and the  deprecated  [1m.HP[0m
       is  a  number  plus an optional scaling unit, as is [1m.RS[22m’s [4minset‐amount[24m.
       If no scaling unit is given, the [4mman[24m package assumes “n”.  An  indenta‐
       tion  specified  in  a call to [1m.IP[22m, [1m.TP[22m, or the deprecated [1m.HP [22mpersists
       until (1) another of these macros is called with an  [4mindentation[24m  argu‐
       ment, or (2) [1m.SH[22m, [1m.SS[22m, or [1m.P [22mor its synonyms is called; these clear the
       indentation entirely.

       The left margin used by ordinary paragraphs set with [1m.P [22m(and  its  syn‐
       onyms) not within an [1m.RS[22m/[1m.RE [22mrelative inset is 7.2n for typesetting de‐
       vices and 7n for terminal devices (but see the [1m-rIN [22moption).   Headers,
       footers  (both set with [1m.TH[22m), and section headings ([1m.SH[22m) are set at the
       page offset (see [4mgroff[24m(7)) and subsection headings ([1m.SS[22m) indented  from
       it by 3n (but see the [1m-rSN [22moption).

       Several  macros  insert vertical space: [1m.SH[22m, [1m.SS[22m, [1m.TP[22m, [1m.P [22m(and its syn‐
       onyms), [1m.IP[22m, and the deprecated [1m.HP[22m.  The default inter‐section and in‐
       ter‐paragraph  spacing is is 1v for terminal devices and 0.4v for type‐
       setting devices.  (The deprecated macro [1m.PD [22mcan  change  this  vertical
       spacing,  but  its use is discouraged.)  Between [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE [22mcalls, the
       inter‐paragraph spacing is 1v regardless of output device.

   [1mRegisters[0m
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They  can  be  set
       not  only  on  the command line but in the site [4mman.local[24m file as well;
       see section “Files” below.

   [1mStrings[0m
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  None of  these
       is  necessary in a contemporary man page; see [4mgroff_man_style[24m(7).  Oth‐
       ers are supported for configuration of rendering parameters;  see  sec‐
       tion “Options” below.

       [1m\*R    [22minterpolates a special character escape sequence for the “regis‐
              tered sign” glyph, [1m\(rg[22m, if available, and “(Reg.)” otherwise.

       [1m\*S    [22minterpolates an escape sequence setting the  type  size  to  the
              document default.

       [1m\*(lq[0m
       [1m\*(rq  [22minterpolate  special  character  escape  sequences  for left and
              right double‐quotation marks, [1m\(lq [22mand [1m\(rq[22m, respectively.

       [1m\*(Tm  [22minterpolates a special character escape sequence for the  “trade
              mark sign” glyph, [1m\(tm[22m, if available, and “(TM)” otherwise.

   [1mHooks[0m
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the [4mgroff[24m [4mman[0m
       package to format page headers and footers and can be redefined by  the
       administrator  in  a site’s [4mman.local[24m file (see section “Files” below).
       The presentation of [1m.TH [22mabove describes the default headers  and  foot‐
       ers.  Because these macros are hooks for [4mgroff[24m [4mman[24m internals, man pages
       have no reason to call them.  Such hook definitions will likely consist
       of  “.sp”  and “.tl” requests.  They must also increase the page length
       with “.pl” requests in continuous rendering mode; [1m.PT  [22mfurthermore  has
       the  responsibility  of emitting a PDF bookmark after writing the first
       page header in a document.  Consult  the  existing  implementations  in
       [4man.tmac[24m when drafting replacements.

       [1m.BT    [22mSet the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       [1m.PT    [22mSet the page header text (“page trap”).

       To  remove  a  page  header  or footer entirely, define the appropriate
       macro as empty rather than deleting it.

   [1mDeprecated features[0m
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution  is  discour‐
       aged.

       [1m.AT [22m[[4msystem[24m [[4mrelease[24m]]
              Alter  the footer for use with legacy AT&T man pages, overriding
              any definition of the [4mfooter‐inside[24m argument to [1m.TH[22m.  This macro
              exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              [4msystem[24m can be any of the following.

                     3      7th edition [4m(default)[0m

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The  optional  [4mrelease[24m argument specifies the release number, as
              in “System V Release 3”.

       [1m.DT    [22mReset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i).

              Use of  this  presentation‐oriented  macro  is  deprecated.   It
              translates  poorly  to HTML, under which exact space control and
              tabulation are not readily available.  Thus, information or dis‐
              tinctions  that  you  use  tab stops to express are likely to be
              lost.  If you feel tempted to change the  tab  stops  such  that
              calling  this  macro  later  is  desirable  to restore them, you
              should probably be composing a table using [4mtbl[24m(1) instead.

       [1m.HP [22m[[4mindentation[24m]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The  [4minden‐[0m
              [4mtation[24m argument, if present, is handled as with [1m.TP[22m.

              Use  of this presentation‐oriented macro is deprecated.  A hang‐
              ing indentation cannot be expressed naturally  under  HTML,  and
              non‐[4mroff[24m‐based  man  page interpreters may treat [1m.HP [22mas an ordi‐
              nary paragraph.  Thus, information or distinctions you  mean  to
              express with indentation may be lost.

       [1m.OP [4m[22moption‐name[24m [[4moption‐argument[24m]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called [4moption‐name[24m, which
              is set in bold.  If the option takes an  argument,  specify  [4mop‐[0m
              [4mtion‐argument[24m  using  a  noun,  abbreviation, or hyphenated noun
              phrase.  If present, [4moption‐argument[24m is preceded by a space  and
              set  in  italics.   Square brackets in roman surround both argu‐
              ments.

              Use of this quasi‐semantic macro, an  extension  originating  in
              Documenter’s  Workbench  [4mtroff[24m, is deprecated.  It cannot easily
              be used to annotate options that take optional arguments or  op‐
              tions whose arguments have internal structure (such as a mixture
              of literal and variable  components).   One  could  work  around
              these  limitations  with font selection escape sequences, but it
              is preferable to use font style alternation macros, which afford
              greater flexibility.

       [1m.PD [22m[[4mvertical‐space[24m]
              Define  the  vertical space between paragraphs or (sub)sections.
              The optional argument [4mvertical‐space[24m specifies the  amount;  the
              default  scaling  unit is “v”.  Without an argument, the spacing
              is reset to its default value; see  subsection  “Horizontal  and
              vertical spacing” above.

              Use  of  this  presentation‐oriented  macro  is  deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control  of  inter‐
              paragraph  spacing  is not readily available.  Thus, information
              or distinctions that you use [1m.PD [22mto express  are  likely  to  be
              lost.

   [1mHistory[0m
       M. Douglas McIlroy  designed,  implemented, and documented the AT&T [4mman[0m
       macros for Unix Version 7 (1979) and employed them to  edit  the  first
       volume  of its [4mProgrammer’s[24m [4mManual[24m, a compilation of all man pages sup‐
       plied by the system.  That [4mman[24m supported the macros listed in this page
       not  described as extensions, except [1m.P [22mand the deprecated [1m.AT [22mand [1m.UC[22m.
       The only strings defined were [1mR [22mand [1mS[22m; no registers were documented.

       [1m.UC [22mappeared in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced [1m.P  [22mand
       exposed  the  registers  [1mIN  [22mand [1mLL[22m, which had been internal to Seventh
       Edition Unix [4mman[24m.  PWB/UNIX 2.0  (1980)  added  the  [1mTm  [22mstring.   4BSD
       (1980)  added  [1mlq [22mand [1mrq [22mstrings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985) recognized [1mC[22m, [1mD[22m, [1mP[22m,
       and [1mX [22mregisters.  4.3BSD (1986) added [1m.AT [22mand [1m.P[22m.   Ninth  Edition  Re‐
       search Unix (1986) introduced [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.  SunOS 4.0 (1988) added [1m.SB[22m.

       The  foregoing features were what James Clark implemented in early ver‐
       sions of [4mgroff[24m.  Later, [4mgroff[24m  1.20  (2009)  originated  [1m.SY[22m/[1m.YS[22m,  [1m.TQ[22m,
       [1m.MT[22m/[1m.ME[22m, and [1m.UR[22m/[1m.UE[22m.  Plan 9 from User Space’s [4mtroff[24m introduced [1m.MR [22min
       2020.

[1mOptions[0m
       The following [4mgroff[24m options set registers (with [1m-r[22m) and  strings  (with
       [1m-d[22m)  recognized and used by the [4mman[24m macro package.  To ensure rendering
       consistent with output device capabilities and reader preferences,  man
       pages should never manipulate them.

       [1m-dAD=[4m[22madjustment‐mode[0m
              Set  line  adjustment to [4madjustment‐mode,[24m which is typically “[1mb[22m”
              for adjustment to both margins (the default), or  “[1ml[22m”  for  left
              alignment  (ragged right margin).  Any valid argument to [4mgroff[24m’s
              “.ad”  request  may  be  used.   See  [4mgroff[24m(7)  for  less‐common
              choices.

       [1m-rcR=1 [22mEnable  continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated; instead,
              one (potentially very long) page is produced.  This is  the  de‐
              fault  for  terminal and HTML devices.  Use [1m-rcR=0 [22mto disable it
              on terminal devices; on HTML devices, it cannot be disabled.

              This  transformation  is off by default because it discards case

              tals  in headers and footers.  This transformation is off by de‐
              fault because it discards case distinction information.

       [1m-rD1   [22mEnable double‐sided layout, formatting footers for even and  odd
              pages  differently;  see  the  description  of [1m.TH [22min subsection
              “Document structure macros” above.

       [1m-rFT=[4m[22mfooter‐distance[0m
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the page to
              [4mfooter‐distance;[24m  this  amount is always negative.  At one half‐
              inch above this location, the page text is broken before writing
              the  footer.   Ignored  if continuous rendering is enabled.  The
              default is -0.5i.

       [1m-dHF=[4m[22mheading‐font[0m
              Set the font used for section and subsection headings;  the  de‐
              fault  is “[1mB[22m” (bold style of the default family).  Any valid ar‐
              gument to [4mgroff[24m’s “.ft” request may be used.  See [4mgroff[24m(7).

       [1m-rHY=0 [22mDisable automatic hyphenation.  Normally,  it  is  enabled  (1).
              The hyphenation mode is determined by the [4mgroff[24m locale; see sec‐
              tion “Localization“ of [4mgroff[24m(7).

       [1m-rIN=[4m[22mstandard‐indentation[0m
              Set the amount of indentation used for ordinary  paragraphs  ([1m.P[0m
              and  its  synonyms)  and  the default indentation amount used by
              [1m.IP[22m, [1m.RS[22m, [1m.TP[22m, and the deprecated [1m.HP[22m.  See subsection “Horizon‐
              tal  and  vertical spacing” above for the default.  For terminal
              devices, [4mstandard‐indentation[24m should always be an integer multi‐
              ple of unit “n” to get consistent indentation.

       [1m-rLL=[4m[22mline‐length[0m
              Set  line  length;  the  default is 78n for terminal devices and
              6.5i for typesetting devices.

       [1m-rLT=[4m[22mtitle‐length[0m
              Set the line length for titles.  By default, it is  set  to  the
              line length (see [1m-rLL [22mabove).

       [1m-dMF=[4m[22mman‐page‐topic‐font[0m
              Set  the  font  used  for  man  page topics named in [1m.TH [22mand [1m.MR[0m
              calls; the default is “[1mI[22m” (italic style of the default  family).
              Any valid argument to [4mgroff[24m’s “.ft” request may be used.  If the
              [1mMF [22mstring ends in “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique  typeface,
              and  italic  corrections  are  applied before and after man page
              topics.

       [1m-rP[4m[22mn[24m   Start enumeration of pages at [4mn[24m.  The default is 1.

       [1m-rS[4m[22mtype‐size[0m
              Use [4mtype‐size[24m for the document’s body  text;  acceptable  values
              are  10,  11,  or 12 points.  See subsection “Font style macros”
              above for the default.

       [1m-rSN=[4m[22msubsection‐indentation[0m
              Set indentation of subsection  headings  to  [4msubsection‐indenta‐[0m
              [4mtion.[24m   See  subsection  “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above
              for the default.

              output  drivers.   [4mgrohtml[24m  enables them by default; [4mgrotty[24m does
              not, pending more widespread pager support for OSC 8 escape  se‐

              package  is being used by a document and loads the correct macro
              definitions, taking advantage of the fact that pages using  them
              must  call [1m.TH [22mor [1m.Dd[22m, respectively, before any other macros.  A
              [4mman[24m program or user typing, for example, “[1mgroff -mandoc page.1[22m”,
              need  not know which package the file [4mpage.1[24m uses.  Multiple man
              pages, in either format, can  be  handled;  [4mandoc[24m  reloads  each
              macro package as necessary.

              Except  for [1m.SB[22m, definitions of macros described above as exten‐
              sions are contained in this file; in some cases, they  are  sim‐
              pler  versions  of definitions appearing in [4man.tmac[24m, and are ig‐
              nored if the formatter is GNU [4mtroff[24m.  They  are  written  to  be
              compatible  with  AT&T [4mtroff[24m and permissively licensed—not copy‐
              lefted.  To reduce the risk of name space collisions, string and
              register  names  begin only with “[1mm[22m”[1m.  [22mWe encourage man page au‐
              thors who are concerned about portability to legacy Unix systems
              to  copy  these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of
              [4mtroff[24m implementations or  work‐alike  systems  that  format  man
              pages to re‐use them.

              The  definitions  for  these  macros are read after a page calls
              [1m.TH[22m, so they will replace any macros of the same names preceding
              it  in  your file.  If you use your own implementations of these
              macros, they must be defined after [1m.TH [22mis called to have any ef‐
              fect.   Furthermore, it is wise to define such page‐local macros
              (if at all) after the “Name” section to accommodate timid  [4mmake‐[0m

       The initial GNU implementation of the [4mman[24m macro package was written  by
       James  Clark.   Later, Werner Lemberg supplied the [1mS[22m, [1mLT[22m, and [1mcR [22mregis‐
       ters, the last a 4.3BSD‐Reno [4mmdoc[24m(7) feature.  Larry Kollar  added  the
       [1mFT[22m,  [1mHY[22m, and [1mSN [22mregisters; the [1mHF [22mstring; and the [1mPT [22mand [1mBT [22mmacros.  G.
       Branden Robinson implemented the [1mAD [22mand [1mMF [22mstrings; [1mCS[22m, [1mCT[22m, and [1mU  [22mreg‐
       isters;  and  the  [1mMR [22mmacro.  Except for [1m.SB[22m, the extension macros were
       written by Lemberg, Eric S. Raymond, and Robinson.

       This document was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux system by
       Susan G. Kleinmann.  It was corrected and updated by Lemberg and Robin‐
       son.  The extension macros were documented by Raymond and Robinson.

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  implementation  of the [4mman[24m macro package is part of the [4mgroff[0m
       document formatting  system.   It  is  used  to  produce  manual  pages
       (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.

       This  document presents the macros thematically; for those needing only
       a quick reference, the following table lists them alphabetically,  with
       cross references to appropriate subsections below.

       We  discuss  other macros ([1m.AT[22m, [1m.DT[22m, [1m.HP[22m, [1m.OP[22m, [1m.PD[22m, and [1m.UC[22m) in subsec‐

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to simply  as
       a  “man  page”, regardless of its length, without gendered implication,
       and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.

       Man pages should be encoded using Unicode basic Latin code  points  ex‐
       clusively, and employ the Unix line‐ending convention (U+000A only).

   [1mFundamental concepts[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  is  a  programming system for typesetting: we thus often use the
       verb “to set” in the sense “to typeset”.  The formatter  [4mtroff[24m(1)  col‐
       lects  words from the input and [4mfills[24m output lines with as many as will
       fit.  [4mWords[24m are separated by spaces and newlines.  A  transition  to  a
       new  output line is called a [4mbreak.[24m  When formatted, a word may be bro‐
       ken at hyphens, at [1m\% [22mor [1m\: [22mescape sequences (see subsection “Portabil‐
       ity”  below), or at predetermined locations if automatic hyphenation is
       enabled (see the [1m-rHY [22moption in section “Options”  below).   An  output
       line may be supplemented with [4minter‐sentence[24m [4mspace,[24m and then optionally
       [4madjusted[24m with more space to a consistent line length (see the [1m-dAD  [22mop‐
       tion).  [4mroff[24m(7) details these processes.

       An input line that starts with a dot (.) or neutral apostrophe (') is a
       [4mcontrol[24m [4mline.[24m  To call a macro, put its name after a dot on  a  control
       line.   We  refer  to  macros  in this document using this leading dot.
       Some macros interpret [4marguments,[24m words that follow the macro  name.   A
       newline, unless escaped (see subsection “Portability” below), marks the
       end of the macro call.  An input line consisting of a dot followed by a
       newline  is  called the [4mempty[24m [4mrequest;[24m it does nothing.  [4mText[24m [4mlines[24m are
       input lines that are not control lines.

       We describe below several [4mman[24m macros that plant one‐line  [4minput[24m  [4mtraps:[0m
       the  next input line that directly produces formatted output is treated
       specially.  For [4mman[24m documents that follow the advice in section “Porta‐
       bility”  below,  this  means that control lines using the empty request
       and uncommented input lines ending  with  an  escaped  newline  do  not
       spring  the  trap;  anything  else does (but see the [1m.TP [22mmacro descrip‐
       tion).

   [1mMacro reference preliminaries[0m
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled pairs  to‐
       gether, as with [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.

       Optional  macro arguments are indicated by surrounding them with square
       brackets.  If a macro  accepts  multiple  arguments,  those  containing
       space characters must be double‐quoted to be interpreted correctly.  An
       empty macro argument can be specified  with  a  pair  of  double‐quotes
       (""),  but  the [4mman[24m package is designed such that this should seldom be
       necessary.  See section “Notes” below for examples of cases where  bet‐
       ter alternatives to empty arguments in macro calls are available.  Most
       macro arguments will be formatted as text in the output; exceptions are
       noted.

   [1mDocument structure macros[0m
       Document  structure  macros organize a man page’s content.  All of them
       break the output line.  [1m.TH [22m(title heading) identifies the document  as
       a  man page and configures the page headers and footers.  Section head‐
       ings ([1m.SH[22m), one of which is mandatory and many of which are convention‐
       ally  expected,  facilitate  location of material by the reader and aid
       the man page writer to discuss all  essential  aspects  of  the  topic.
       Subsection  headings  ([1m.SS[22m)  are optional and permit sections that grow
       long to develop in a controlled way.  Many technical discussions  bene‐
       fit  from  examples; lengthy ones, especially those reflecting multiple
       lines of input to or output from the system, are usefully bracketed  by
       [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.  When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand, use
       [1m.RS[22m/[1m.RE [22mto inset a region within a (sub)section.

       [1m.TH [4m[22mtopic[24m [4msection[24m [[4mfooter‐middle[24m] [[4mfooter‐inside[24m] [[4mheader‐middle[24m]
              Determine the contents of the page header and footer.  [4mroff[24m sys‐
              tems  refer  to  these collectively as “titles”.  The subject of
              the man page is [4mtopic[24m and the section of the manual to which  it
              belongs  is  [4msection.[24m   This  use of “section” has nothing to do
              with the section headings otherwise discussed in this  page;  it
              arises  from the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix
              manuals.  See [4mman[24m(1) or [4mintro[24m(1) for the manual  sectioning  ap‐
              plicable  to  your system.  [4mtopic[24m and [4msection[24m are positioned to‐
              gether at the left and right in  the  header  (with  [4msection[24m  in
              parentheses  immediately  appended  to [4mtopic[24m).  [4mfooter‐middle[24m is
              centered in the footer.  The arrangement  of  the  rest  of  the
              footer  depends  on  whether double‐sided layout is enabled with
              the option [1m-rD1[22m.  When disabled (the default), [4mfooter‐inside[24m  is
              positioned at the bottom left.  Otherwise, [4mfooter‐inside[24m appears
              at the bottom left on recto (odd‐numbered)  pages,  and  at  the
              bottom right on verso (even‐numbered) pages.  The outside footer
              is the page number, except in the continuous‐rendering mode  en‐
              abled  by  the  option [1m-rcR=1[22m, in which case it is the [4mtopic[24m and
              [4msection,[24m as in the header.  [4mheader‐middle[24m  is  centered  in  the
              header.   If  [4msection[24m is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive),
              there is no need to specify [4mheader‐middle;[24m [4man.tmac[24m  will  supply
              text  for  it.   The macro package may also abbreviate [4mtopic[24m and
              [4mfooter‐inside[24m with ellipses ([1m...[22m)  if  they  would  overrun  the
              space  available  in  the  header and footer, respectively.  For
              HTML output, headers and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro breaks the page, resetting  the  number
              to  1  (unless  the  [1m-rC1 [22moption is given).  This feature is in‐
              tended only for formatting multiple [4mman[24m documents in sequence.

              A valid [4mman[24m document calls [1m.TH [22monce, early in the file, prior to
              any other macro calls.

              By convention, [4mfooter‐middle[24m is the date of the most recent mod‐
              ification to the man page source document, and [4mfooter‐inside[24m  is
              the name and version or release of the project providing it.

       [1m.SH [22m[[4mheading‐text[24m]
              Set [4mheading‐text[24m as a section heading.  If no argument is given,
              a one‐line input trap is planted; text on the next line  becomes
              [4mheading‐text.[24m  The left margin is reset to zero to set the head‐
              ing text in bold (or the font specified by the string [1mHF[22m),  and,
              on typesetting devices, slightly larger than the base type size.
              If the heading font [1m\*[HF] [22mis bold, use of an  italic  style  in
              [4mheading‐text[24m  is mapped to the bold‐italic style if available in
              the font family.  The inset level is reset  to  1,  setting  the
              left  margin  to the value of the [1mIN [22mregister.  Text after [4mhead‐[0m
              [4ming‐text[24m is set as an ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m).

              The content of [4mheading‐text[24m and ordering of sections  follows  a
              set  of  common practices, as has much of the layout of material
              within sections.  For example, a section called “Name” or “NAME”
              must  exist,  must  be the first section after the [1m.TH [22mcall, and
              must contain only text of the form
                     [4mtopic[24m[[1m, [4m[22manother‐topic[24m]... \- [4msummary‐description[0m
              for a man page to be properly indexed.  See [4mman[24m(7) for the  con‐
              ventions prevailing on your system.

       [1m.SS [22m[[4msubheading‐text[24m]
              Set  [4msubheading‐text[24m  as a subsection heading indented between a
              section heading and an ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m).  If no  argument
              is  given,  a  one‐line  input trap is planted; text on the next
              line becomes [4msubheading‐text.[24m  The left margin is reset  to  the
              value of the [1mSN [22mregister to set the heading text in bold (or the
              font specified by the string [1mHF[22m).  If the heading font [1m\*[HF] [22mis
              bold, use of an italic style in [4msubheading‐text[24m is mapped to the
              bold‐italic style if available in the font  family.   The  inset
              level is reset to 1, setting the left margin to the value of the
              [1mIN [22mregister.  Text after [4msubheading‐text[24m is set as  an  ordinary
              paragraph ([1m.P[22m).

       [1m.EX[0m
       [1m.EE    [22mBegin  and  end  example.   After [1m.EX[22m, filling is disabled and a
              constant‐width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling  [1m.EE  [22men‐
              ables filling and restores the previous font.

              Example  regions are useful for formatting code, shell sessions,
              and text file contents.  An example region  is  not  a  “literal
              mode” of any sort: special character escape sequences must still
              be used to produce correct glyphs for [1m'[22m, [1m-[22m, [1m\[22m, [1m^[22m, [1m`[22m, and [1m~[22m,  and
              sentence  endings  are  still detected and additional inter‐sen‐
              tence space applied.  If the amount of additional inter‐sentence
              spacing  is altered, the rendering of, for instance, regular ex‐
              pressions using [1m. [22mor [1m? [22mfollowed by multiple spaces  can  change.
              Use the dummy character escape sequence [1m\& [22mbefore the spaces.

              These macros are extensions introduced in Ninth Edition Research
              Unix.  Systems running that [4mtroff[24m, or  those  from  Documenter’s
              Workbench,  Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 [4mtroff[24m support them.  To
              be certain your page will be portable to systems  that  do  not,
              copy  their definitions from the [4man-ext.tmac[24m file of a [4mgroff[24m in‐
              stallation.

       [1m.RS [22m[[4minset‐amount[24m]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The position of the left mar‐
              gin  is  saved,  then moved right by [4minset‐amount,[24m if specified,
              and by the amount of the [1mIN [22mregister otherwise.   Calls  to  [1m.RS[0m
              can be nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by [1m.RE[22m.
              The level prior to any [1m.RS [22mcalls is 1.

       [1m.RE [22m[[4mlevel[24m]
              End a relative inset.  The left margin  corresponding  to  inset
              level  [4mlevel[24m  is  restored.   If no argument is given, the inset
              level is reduced by 1.

   [1mParagraphing macros[0m
       An ordinary paragraph ([1m.P[22m) like this one is set  without  a  first‐line
       indentation at the current left margin.  In man pages and other techni‐
       cal literature, definition lists are frequently encountered; these  can
       be set as “tagged paragraphs”, which have one ([1m.TP[22m) or more ([1m.TQ[22m) lead‐
       ing tags followed by a paragraph that has  an  additional  indentation.
       The  indented  paragraph ([1m.IP[22m) macro is useful to continue the indented
       content of a narrative started with [1m.TP[22m, or to present an  itemized  or
       ordered  list.   All of these macros break the output line.  If another
       paragraph macro has occurred since the previous [1m.SH [22mor [1m.SS[22m,  they  (ex‐
       cept for [1m.TQ[22m) follow the break with a default amount of vertical space,
       which can be changed by the deprecated [1m.PD [22mmacro; see subsection “Hori‐
       zontal  and vertical spacing” below.  They also reset the type size and
       font style to defaults ([1m.TQ [22magain excepted); see subsection “Font style
       macros” below.

       [1m.P[0m
       [1m.LP[0m
       [1m.PP    [22mBegin  a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  The inden‐
              tation is reset to the default value; the left  margin,  as  af‐
              fected by [1m.RS [22mand [1m.RE[22m, is not.

       [1m.TP [22m[[4mindentation[24m]
              Set  a  paragraph  with  a leading tag, and the remainder of the
              paragraph indented.  A one‐line input trap is planted;  text  on
              the  next line, which can be formatted with a macro, becomes the
              tag, which is placed at the current left margin.  The tag can be
              extended  with  the  [1m\c [22mescape sequence.  Subsequent text is in‐
              dented by [4mindentation,[24m if specified, and by the amount of the [1mIN[0m
              register  otherwise.   If the tag is not as wide as the indenta‐
              tion, the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,  at  the
              applicable  indentation,  and  continues on the following lines.
              Otherwise, the descriptive part of the paragraph begins  on  the
              line following the tag.

              The  line  containing  the tag can include a macro call, for in‐
              stance to set the tag in bold with [1m.B[22m.  [1m.TP [22mwas  used  to  write
              the first paragraph of this description of [1m.TP[22m, and [1m.IP [22mthe sub‐
              sequent one.

       [1m.TQ    [22mSet an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with [1m.TP[22m.  An input
              trap is planted as with [1m.TP[22m.

              This  macro  is  a  GNU extension not defined on systems running
              AT&T, Plan 9, or  Solaris  [4mtroff[24m;  see  [4man-ext.tmac[24m  in  section
              “Files” below.

              The  descriptions  of  [1m.P[22m, [1m.LP[22m, and [1m.PP [22mabove were written using
              [1m.TP [22mand [1m.TQ[22m.

       [1m.IP [22m[[4mtag[24m] [[4mindentation[24m]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional tag.  The [4mtag[24m and [4min‐[0m
              [4mdentation[24m  arguments,  if present, are handled as with [1m.TP[22m, with
              the exception that the [4mtag[24m argument  to  [1m.IP  [22mcannot  include  a
              macro call.

              Two convenient uses for [1m.IP [22mare

                  (1) to start a new paragraph with the same indentation as an
                      immediately preceding [1m.IP [22mor [1m.TP [22mparagraph, if no [4minden‐[0m
                      [4mtation[24m argument is given; and

                  (2) to set a paragraph with a short [4mtag[24m that is not semanti‐
                      cally important, such as a bullet (•)—obtained with  the
                      [1m\(bu  [22mspecial character escape sequence—or list enumera‐
                      tor, as seen in this very paragraph.

   [1mCommand synopsis macros[0m
       [1m.SY [22mand [1m.YS [22maid you to construct a command synopsis that has the  clas‐
       sical Unix appearance.  They break the output line.

       These  macros  are  GNU extensions not defined on systems running AT&T,
       Plan 9, or Solaris [4mtroff[24m; see [4man-ext.tmac[24m in section “Files” below.

       [1m.SY [4m[22mcommand[0m
              Begin synopsis.  A new paragraph begins at the left  margin  (as
              with  [1m.P[22m)  unless  [1m.SY  [22mhas already been called without a corre‐
              sponding [1m.YS[22m, in which case only a break is performed.   Adjust‐
              ment  and automatic hyphenation are disabled.  [4mcommand[24m is set in
              bold.  If a break is required, lines after  the  first  are  in‐
              dented by the width of [4mcommand[24m plus a space.

       [1m.YS    [22mEnd  synopsis.  Indentation, adjustment, and hyphenation are re‐
              stored to their previous states.

       Multiple [1m.SY[22m/[1m.YS [22mblocks can be specified, for instance  to  distinguish
       differing  modes  of  operation  of a complex command like [4mtar[24m(1); each
       will be vertically separated as paragraphs are.

       [1m.SY [22mcan be repeated before [1m.YS [22mto indicate synonymous ways of  invoking
       a particular mode of operation.

       [4mgroff[24m’s  own  command‐line  interface  serves to illustrate most of the
       specimens of synopsis syntax one is likely to encounter.

       Several features of the above example are of note.

       • The  empty  request  (.),  which  does nothing, is used to vertically
         space the input file for readability by the document maintainer.   Do
         not put blank (empty) lines in a man page source document.

       • Command  and  option names are presented in [1mbold [22mto cue the user that
         they should be input literally.

       • Option dashes are specified with the [1m\- [22mescape sequence; this  is  an
         important  practice  to  make  them clearly visible and to facilitate
         copy‐and‐paste from the rendered man page to a shell prompt  or  text
         file.

       • Option  arguments  and command operands are presented in [4mitalics[24m (but
         see subsection “Font style macros” below regarding terminals) to  cue
         the user that they must be replaced with appropriate text.

       • Symbols  that  are  neither to be typed literally nor replaced at the
         user’s discretion appear in the roman style;  brackets  surround  op‐
         tional arguments, and an ellipsis indicates that the previous syntac‐
         tical element may be repeated arbitrarily.

       • The non‐breaking adjustable space escape sequence [1m\~ [22mis used to  pre‐
         vent  the  output  line from being broken within the option brackets;
         see subsection “Portability” below.

       The  arguments  to [1m.MR[22m, [1m.MT[22m, and [1m.UR [22mshould be prepared for typesetting
       since they can appear in the output.  Use special character escape  se‐
       quences  to encode Unicode basic Latin characters where necessary, par‐
       ticularly the hyphen‐minus.  (See section “Portability”  below.)   URIs
       can  be  lengthy;  rendering  them  can result in jarring adjustment or
       variations in line length, or [4mtroff[24m warnings when a hyperlink is longer
       than  an  output line.  The application of non‐printing break point es‐
       cape sequences [1m\: [22mafter each slash (or series thereof), and before each
       dot  (or series thereof) is recommended as a rule of thumb.  The former
       practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto a separate  out‐
       put  line,  and  the latter helps the reader to avoid mistakenly inter‐
       preting a dot at the end of a line as a period (or multiple dots as  an
       ellipsis).  Thus,
              .UR http://\:example\:.com/\:fb8afcfbaebc74e\:.cc
       has  several  potential break points in the URI shown.  Consider adding
       break points before or after at signs in email addresses, and  question
       marks, ampersands, and number signs in HTTP(S) URIs.  The formatter re‐

   [1mFont style macros[0m
       The  [4mman[24m macro package is limited in its font styling options, offering
       only [1mbold [22m([1m.B[22m), [4mitalic[24m ([1m.I[22m), and roman.  Italic text is usually set un‐
       derscored instead on terminal devices.  The [1m.SM [22mand [1m.SB [22mmacros set text
       in roman or bold, respectively, at a smaller type  size;  these  differ
       visually  from regular‐sized roman or bold text only on typesetting de‐
       vices.  It is often necessary to set text in different  styles  without
       intervening  space.  The macros [1m.BI[22m, [1m.BR[22m, [1m.IB[22m, [1m.IR[22m, [1m.RB[22m, and [1m.RI[22m, where
       “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate bold, italic, and roman,  respectively,  set
       their  odd‐  and even‐numbered arguments in alternating styles, with no
       space separating them.

       Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic,  conflict‐
       ing  traditions  have arisen regarding which font styles should be used
       to mark file or path names, environment variables, and  inlined  liter‐
       als.

       The  default  type  size and family for typesetting devices is 10‐point
       Times, except on the [1mX75-12 [22mand [1mX100-12 [22mdevices where the type size  is
       12 points.  The default style is roman.

       [1m.B [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set  [4mtext[24m  in  bold.   If no argument is given, a one‐line input
              trap is planted; text on the next line,  which  can  be  further
              formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

              Use  bold  for literal portions of syntax synopses, for command‐
              line options in running text, and for literals  that  are  major
              topics  of  the subject under discussion; for example, this page
              uses bold for macro, string, and register names.  In an  [1m.EX[22m/[1m.EE[0m
              example  of  interactive I/O (such as a shell session), set only
              user input in bold.

       [1m.I [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set [4mtext[24m in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is given,
              a  one‐line  input trap is planted; text on the next line, which
              can be further formatted with a macro, is set in  an  italic  or
              oblique face.

              Use  italics for file and path names, for environment variables,
              for C data types, for enumeration or preprocessor  constants  in
              C,  for  variant (user‐replaceable) portions of syntax synopses,
              for the first occurrence (only) of a technical concept being in‐
              troduced,  for  names  of  journals and of literary works longer
              than an article, and anywhere a parameter requiring  replacement
              by  the user is encountered.  An exception involves variant text
              in a context already typeset in italics, such as  file  or  path
              names  with  replaceable  components;  in such cases, follow the
              convention of mathematical typography: set the file or path name
              in  italics as usual but use roman for the variant part (see [1m.IR[0m
              and [1m.RI [22mbelow), and italics again in running roman text when re‐
              ferring to the variant material.

       [1m.SM [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set  [4mtext[24m  one point smaller than the default type size on type‐
              setting devices.  If no argument is given, a one‐line input trap
              is  planted; text on the next line, which can be further format‐
              ted with a macro, is set smaller.

              [4mNote:[24m terminals will render [4mtext[24m at normal size instead.  Do not
              rely  upon [1m.SM [22mto communicate semantic information distinct from
              using roman style at normal size; it will be hidden from readers
              using such devices.

       [1m.SB [22m[[4mtext[24m]
              Set  [4mtext[24m in bold and (on typesetting devices) one point smaller
              than the default type size.  If no argument is given, a one‐line
              input  trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be fur‐
              ther formatted with a macro, is set smaller and in  bold.   This
              macro is an extension introduced in SunOS 4.0.

              [4mNote:[24m  terminals will render [4mtext[24m in bold at the normal size in‐
              stead.  Do not rely upon [1m.SB [22mto communicate semantic information
              distinct from using bold style at normal size; it will be hidden
              from readers using such devices.

       Observe what is [4mnot[24m prescribed for setting in bold  or  italics  above:
       elements  of  “synopsis  language” such as ellipses and brackets around
       options; proper names and adjectives; titles of anything other than ma‐
       jor works of literature; identifiers for standards documents or techni‐
       cal reports such as CSTR #54, RFC 1918, Unicode 13.0, or  POSIX.1‐2017;
       acronyms; and occurrences after the first of a technical term.

       Be frugal with italics for emphasis, and particularly with bold.  Arti‐
       cle titles and brief runs of literal text, such as references to  indi‐
       vidual  characters  or  short strings, including section and subsection
       headings of man pages, are suitable  objects  for  quotation;  see  the
       [1m\(lq[22m, [1m\(rq[22m, [1m\(oq[22m, and [1m\(cq [22mescape sequences in subsection “Portability”
       below.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style  alternation  macros
       below  set no input traps; they must be given arguments to have effect.
       Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.  If a space is  required
       within  an  argument,  first  consider whether the same result could be
       achieved with as much clarity by using single‐style macros on  separate
       input  lines.   When it cannot, double‐quote an argument containing em‐
       bedded space characters.  Setting all three different styles  within  a
       word  presents  challenges; it is possible with the [1m\c [22mand/or [1m\f [22mescape
       sequences.  See subsection “Portability” below for approaches.

   [1mHorizontal and vertical spacing[0m
       The [4mindentation[24m argument accepted by [1m.IP[22m, [1m.TP[22m, and the  deprecated  [1m.HP[0m
       is  a  number  plus an optional scaling unit, as is [1m.RS[22m’s [4minset‐amount[24m.
       If no scaling unit is given, the [4mman[24m package assumes “n”; that is,  the
       width of a letter “n” in the font current when the macro is called (see
       section “Measurements” in [4mgroff[24m(7)).  An  indentation  specified  in  a
       call  to  [1m.IP[22m, [1m.TP[22m, or the deprecated [1m.HP [22mpersists until (1) another of
       these macros is called with an [4mindentation[24m argument, or (2)  [1m.SH[22m,  [1m.SS[22m,
       or [1m.P [22mor its synonyms is called; these clear the indentation entirely.

       The  left  margin used by ordinary paragraphs set with [1m.P [22m(and its syn‐
       onyms) not within an [1m.RS[22m/[1m.RE [22mrelative inset is 7.2n for typesetting de‐
       vices  and 7n for terminal devices (but see the [1m-rIN [22moption).  Headers,
       footers (both set with [1m.TH[22m), and section headings ([1m.SH[22m) are set at  the
       page  offset (see [4mgroff[24m(7)) and subsection headings ([1m.SS[22m) indented from
       it by 3n (but see the [1m-rSN [22moption).

       It may be helpful to think of the left margin and  indentation  as  re‐
       lated  but  distinct  concepts; [4mgroff[24m’s implementation of the [4mman[24m macro
       package tracks them separately.  The left margin is manipulated by  [1m.RS[0m
       and  [1m.RE [22m(and by [1m.SH [22mand [1m.SS[22m, which reset it to the default).  Indenta‐
       tion is controlled by the paragraphing macros (though, again,  [1m.SH  [22mand
       [1m.SS  [22mreset  it);  it  is  imposed  by  the [1m.TP[22m, [1m.IP[22m, and deprecated [1m.HP[0m
       macros, and cancelled by [1m.P [22mand its  synonyms.   An  extensive  example
       follows.

       This  ordinary  ([1m.P[22m)  paragraph  is not in a relative inset nor does it
       possess an indentation.

              Now we have created a relative inset (in other words, moved  the
              left  margin)  with  [1m.RS  [22mand started another ordinary paragraph
              with [1m.P[22m.

              [1mtag    [22mThis tagged paragraph, set with [1m.TP[22m, is still within  the
                     [1m.RS  [22mregion,  but lines after the first have a supplemen‐
                     tary indentation that the tag lacks.

                     A paragraph like this one, set with [1m.IP[22m, will  appear  to
                     the reader as also associated with the tag above, because
                     [1m.IP [22mre‐uses the previous paragraph’s  indentation  unless
                     given  an  argument  to change it.  This paragraph is af‐
                     fected both by the moved left margin ([1m.RS[22m)  and  indenta‐
                     tion ([1m.IP[22m).
                     ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                     │This table is affected both by   │
                     │the left margin and indentation. │
                     └─────────────────────────────────┘
              •      This indented paragraph has a bullet for a tag, making it
                     more obvious that the left  margin  and  indentation  are
                     distinct;  only  the former affects the tag, but both af‐
                     fect the text of the paragraph.

              This ordinary ([1m.P[22m) paragraph resets  the  indentation,  but  the
              left margin is still inset.
              ┌────────────────────────────┐
              │This table is affected only │
              │by the left margin.         │
              └────────────────────────────┘
       Finally,  we have ended the relative inset by using [1m.RE[22m, which (because
       we used only one [1m.RS[22m/[1m.RE [22mpair) has reset the left  margin  to  the  de‐
       fault.  This is an ordinary [1m.P [22mparagraph.

       Resist  the  temptation  to mock up tabular or multi‐column output with
       tab characters or the indentation arguments to [1m.IP[22m, [1m.TP[22m,  [1m.RS[22m,  or  the
       deprecated  [1m.HP[22m;  the result may not render comprehensibly on an output
       device you fail to check, or which is developed in the future.  The ta‐
       ble preprocessor [4mtbl[24m(1) can likely meet your needs.

       Several  macros  insert vertical space: [1m.SH[22m, [1m.SS[22m, [1m.TP[22m, [1m.P [22m(and its syn‐
       onyms), [1m.IP[22m, and the deprecated [1m.HP[22m.  The default inter‐section and in‐
       ter‐paragraph  spacing is is 1v for terminal devices and 0.4v for type‐
       setting devices (“v” is a unit of vertical distance, where  1v  is  the
       distance  between adjacent text baselines in a single‐spaced document).
       (The deprecated macro [1m.PD [22mcan change this vertical spacing, but its use
       is  discouraged.)  Between [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE [22mcalls, the inter‐paragraph spac‐
       ing is 1v regardless of output device.

   [1mRegisters[0m
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They  can  be  set
       not  only  on  the command line but in the site [4mman.local[24m file as well;
       see section “Files” below.

   [1mStrings[0m
       The following strings are defined for use in  man  pages.   Others  are
       supported  for  configuration of rendering parameters; see section “Op‐
       tions” below.

       [1m\*R    [22minterpolates a special character escape sequence for the “regis‐
              tered sign” glyph, [1m\(rg[22m, if available, and “(Reg.)” otherwise.

       [1m\*S    [22minterpolates  an  escape  sequence  setting the type size to the
              document default.

       [1m\*(lq[0m
       [1m\*(rq  [22minterpolate special character  escape  sequences  for  left  and
              right double‐quotation marks, [1m\(lq [22mand [1m\(rq[22m, respectively.

       [1m\*(Tm  [22minterpolates  a special character escape sequence for the “trade
              mark sign” glyph, [1m\(tm[22m, if available, and “(TM)” otherwise.

       None of the above is necessary in a contemporary man page.  [1m\*S [22mis  su‐
       perfluous,  since  type  size changes are invisible on terminal devices
       and macros that change it restore its original value afterward.  Better
       alternatives  exist  for the rest; simply use the [1m\(rg[22m, [1m\(lq[22m, [1m\(rq[22m, and
       [1m\(tm [22mspecial character escape sequences directly.  Unless  a  man  page
       author  is  aiming for a pathological level of portability, such as the
       composition of pages for consumption on simulators of 1980s  Unix  sys‐
       tems  (or  Solaris  [4mtroff[24m,  though  even  it  supports [1m\(rg[22m), the above
       strings should be avoided.

   [1mPortability[0m
       It is wise to quote multi‐word section and subsection headings; the [1m.SH[0m
       and [1m.SS [22mmacros of [4mman[24m(7) implementations descended from Seventh Edition
       Unix supported six arguments at most.  A similar restriction applied to
       the [1m.B[22m, [1m.I[22m, [1m.SM[22m, and font style alternation macros.

       The two major syntactical categories for formatting control in the [4mroff[0m
       language are requests and escape sequences.  Since the [4mman[24m  macros  are
       implemented  in  terms of [4mgroff[24m requests and escape sequences, one can,
       in principle, supplement the functionality of  [4mman[24m  with  these  lower‐
       level elements where necessary.

       However, using raw [4mgroff[24m requests (apart from the empty request “[1m.[22m”) is
       likely to make your page render poorly when processed by  other  tools;
       many of these attempt to interpret page sources directly for conversion
       to HTML.  Some requests make implicit  assumptions  about  things  like
       character  and  page  sizes  that  may not hold in an HTML environment;
       also, many of these viewers don’t interpret the full [4mgroff[24m  vocabulary,
       a  problem that can lead to portions of your text being omitted or pre‐
       sented incomprehensibly.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page solely
       with  the macros described in this page (except for the ones identified
       as deprecated, which should be avoided).  The macros we have  described
       as  extensions  ([1m.EX[22m/[1m.EE[22m, [1m.SY[22m/[1m.YS[22m, [1m.TQ[22m, [1m.UR[22m/[1m.UE[22m, [1m.MT[22m/[1m.ME[22m, [1m.MR[22m, and [1m.SB[22m)
       should be used with caution, as they may not be built in to some viewer
       that is important to your audience.  See [4man-ext.tmac[24m in section “Files”
       below.

       Similar caveats apply to escape sequences.  Some escape  sequences  are
       however  required for correct typesetting even in man pages and usually
       do not cause portability problems.  Several of these render glyphs cor‐
       responding  to punctuation code points in the Unicode basic Latin range
       (U+0000–U+007F) that are handled specially in [4mroff[24m  input;  the  escape
       sequences below must be used to render them correctly and portably when
       documenting material that uses them syntactically—namely,  any  of  the
       set [1m' - \ ^ ` ~ [22m(apostrophe, dash or minus, backslash, caret, grave ac‐
       cent, tilde).

       [1m\"     [22mComment.  Everything after the double‐quote to the  end  of  the
              input line is ignored.  Whole‐line comments should be placed im‐
              mediately after the empty request (“[1m.[22m”).

       [1m\[4m[22mnewline[0m
              Join the next input line to the current one.  Except for the up‐
              date of the input line counter (used for diagnostic messages and
              related purposes), a series of lines ending in backslash‐newline
              appears  to  [4mgroff[24m  as a single input line.  Use this escape se‐
              quence to split excessively long input lines for document  main‐
              tenance.

       [1m\%     [22mControl  hyphenation.   The  location  of  this  escape sequence
              within a word marks a hyphenation point,  supplementing  [4mgroff[24m’s
              automatic  hyphenation patterns.  At the beginning of a word, it
              suppresses any hyphenation breaks within [4mexcept[24m those  specified
              with [1m\%[22m.

       [1m\:     [22mInsert  a  non‐printing break point.  A word can break at such a
              point, but a hyphen glyph is not written to  the  output  if  it
              does.   This  escape  sequence is an input word boundary, so the
              remainder of the word is subject to hyphenation as normal.   You
              can  use  [1m\: [22mand [1m\% [22min combination to control breaking of a file
              name or URI or to permit hyphenation only after certain explicit
              hyphens  within a word.  See subsection “Hyperlink macros” above
              for an example.

              This escape sequence is a  [4mgroff[24m  extension  also  supported  by
              Heirloom  Doctools  [4mtroff[24m 050915 (September 2005), [4mmandoc[24m 1.14.5
              (2019‐03‐10), and [4mneatroff[24m (commit  399a4936,  2014‐02‐17),  but
              not by Plan 9, Solaris, or Documenter’s Workbench [4mtroff[24ms.

       [1m\~     [22mAdjustable non‐breaking space.  Use this escape sequence to pre‐
              vent a break inside a short phrase or between a numerical  quan‐

              This  escape  sequence  is  a  [4mgroff[24m extension also supported by
              Heirloom Doctools [4mtroff[24m 050915 (September  2005),  [4mmandoc[24m  1.9.5

              Plan 9 from User Space [4mtroff[24m  (commit  93f8143600,  2022‐08‐12),
              but not by Solaris or Documenter’s Workbench [4mtroff[24ms.

       [1m\&     [22mDummy  character.   Insert  at the beginning of an input line to
              prevent a dot or apostrophe from being interpreted as  beginning
              a  [4mroff[24m  control line.  Append to an end‐of‐sentence punctuation
              sequence to keep it from being recognized as such.

       [1m\|     [22mThin space (one‐sixth em on typesetters,  zero‐width  on  termi‐
              nals);   a  non‐breaking  space.   Used  primarily  in  ellipses
              (“.\|.\|.”)  to space the dots more  pleasantly  on  typesetting
              devices like [1mdvi[22m, [1mpdf[22m, and [1mps[22m.

       [1m\c     [22mEnd  a  text line without inserting space or attempting a break.
              Normally, if filling is enabled, the  end  of  a  text  line  is
              treated  like  a  space;  an output line [4mmay[24m be broken there (if
              not, an adjustable space is inserted); if filling  is  disabled,
              the line [4mwill[24m be broken there, as in [1m.EX[22m/[1m.EE [22mexamples.  The next
              line is interpreted as usual and can include a macro call  (con‐
              trast  with  [1m\[4m[22mnewline[24m).  [1m\c [22mis useful when three font styles are
              needed in a single word, as in a command synopsis.

              It also helps when changing font  styles  in  [1m.EX[22m/[1m.EE  [22mexamples,
              since they are not filled.

                     .EX

                     .EE

              Alternatively,  and perhaps with better portability, the [1m\f [22mfont
              selection escape sequence can be used; see below.  Using  [1m\c  [22mto
              continue  a  [1m.TP  [22mparagraph tag across multiple input lines will
              render incorrectly with [4mgroff[24m 1.22.3, [4mmandoc[24m 1.14.1, older  ver‐
              sions of these programs, and perhaps with some other formatters.

       [1m\e     [22mFormat  the  current escape character on the output; widely used
              in man pages to render a backslash glyph.  It works reliably  as
              long as the “.ec” request is not used, which should never happen
              in man pages, and it is slightly more portable than the more ex‐
              plicit  [1m\(rs  [22m(“reverse  solidus”)  special character escape se‐
              quence.

                     .IR name ]

              Style escape sequences may be more portable than [1m\c[22m.   As  shown
              above,  it  is  up to you to account for italic corrections with
              “[1m\/[22m” and “[1m\,[22m”, which are themselves GNU extensions,  if  desired
              and if supported by your implementation.

              [1m\fP  [22mreliably  returns to the style in use immediately preceding
              the previous [1m\f [22mescape sequence only  if  no  sectioning,  para‐
              graph, or style macro calls have intervened.

              As long as at most two styles are needed in a word, style macros
              like [1m.B [22mand [1m.BI [22musually result in more readable [4mroff[24m source than
              [1m\f [22mescape sequences do.

       Several  special  characters  are also widely portable.  Except for [1m\-[22m,
       [1m\(em[22m, and [1m\(ga[22m, AT&T [4mtroff[24m did not consistently define  the  characters
       listed below, but its descendants, like Plan 9 or Solaris [4mtroff[24m, can be
       made to support them by defining them in font description files, making
       them aliases of existing glyphs if necessary; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       [1m\-     [22mMinus  sign  or  basic Latin hyphen‐minus.  This escape sequence
              produces the Unix command‐line option dash in the  output.   “[1m-[22m”
              is a hyphen in the [4mroff[24m language; some output devices replace it
              with U+2010 (hyphen) or similar.

       [1m\(aq   [22mBasic Latin neutral apostrophe.  Some output devices format  “[1m'[22m”
              as a right single quotation mark.

              tween numbers; for example, “the digits 1–9”.

       [1m\(ga   [22mBasic  Latin  grave accent.  Some output devices format “[1m`[22m” as a
              left single quotation mark.

       [1m\(ha   [22mBasic Latin circumflex accent (“hat”).  Some output devices for‐
              mat  “[1m^[22m”  as U+02C6 (modifier letter circumflex accent) or simi‐
              lar.

              itself in output.  Also see [1m\e [22mabove.

       [1m\(ti   [22mBasic Latin tilde.  Some output devices  format  “[1m~[22m”  as  U+02DC
              (small tilde) or similar.

       For  maximum  portability,  escape sequences and special characters not
       listed above are better avoided in man pages.

   [1mHooks[0m
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the [4mgroff[24m [4mman[0m
       package  to format page headers and footers and can be redefined by the
       administrator in a site’s [4mman.local[24m file (see section  “Files”  below).
       The  presentation  of [1m.TH [22mabove describes the default headers and foot‐
       ers.  Because these macros are hooks for [4mgroff[24m [4mman[24m internals, man pages
       have no reason to call them.  Such hook definitions will likely consist
       of “.sp” and “.tl” requests.  They must also increase the  page  length
       with  “.pl”  requests in continuous rendering mode; [1m.PT [22mfurthermore has

              exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              [4msystem[24m can be any of the following.

              in “System V Release 3”.

       [1m.DT    [22mReset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i [inches]).

              Use  of  this  presentation‐oriented  macro  is  deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact space  control  and
              tabulation are not readily available.  Thus, information or dis‐
              tinctions that you use tab stops to express  are  likely  to  be
              lost.   If  you  feel  tempted to change the tab stops such that
              calling this macro later  is  desirable  to  restore  them,  you
              should probably be composing a table using [4mtbl[24m(1) instead.

       [1m.HP [22m[[4mindentation[24m]
              Set  up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The [4minden‐[0m
              [4mtation[24m argument, if present, is handled as with [1m.TP[22m.

              Use of this presentation‐oriented macro is deprecated.  A  hang‐
              ing  indentation  cannot  be expressed naturally under HTML, and
              non‐[4mroff[24m‐based man page interpreters may treat [1m.HP [22mas  an  ordi‐
              nary  paragraph.   Thus, information or distinctions you mean to
              express with indentation may be lost.

       [1m.OP [4m[22moption‐name[24m [[4moption‐argument[24m]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called [4moption‐name[24m, which
              is  set  in  bold.  If the option takes an argument, specify [4mop‐[0m
              [4mtion‐argument[24m using a noun,  abbreviation,  or  hyphenated  noun
              phrase.   If present, [4moption‐argument[24m is preceded by a space and
              set in italics.  Square brackets in roman  surround  both  argu‐
              ments.

              Use  of  this  quasi‐semantic macro, an extension originating in
              Documenter’s Workbench [4mtroff[24m, is deprecated.  It  cannot  easily
              be  used to annotate options that take optional arguments or op‐
              tions whose arguments have internal structure (such as a mixture
              of  literal  and  variable  components).   One could work around
              these limitations with font selection escape sequences,  but  it
              is preferable to use font style alternation macros, which afford
              greater flexibility.

       [1m.PD [22m[[4mvertical‐space[24m]
              Define the vertical space between paragraphs  or  (sub)sections.
              The  optional  argument [4mvertical‐space[24m specifies the amount; the
              default scaling unit is “v”.  Without an argument,  the  spacing
              is  reset  to  its default value; see subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” above.

              Use of  this  presentation‐oriented  macro  is  deprecated.   It
              translates  poorly  to HTML, under which exact control of inter‐

              or  distinctions  that  you  use [1m.PD [22mto express are likely to be

   [1mHistory[0m
       M. Douglas McIlroy designed, implemented, and documented the  AT&T  [4mman[0m
       macros  for  Unix  Version 7 (1979) and employed them to edit the first
       volume of its [4mProgrammer’s[24m [4mManual[24m, a compilation of all man pages  sup‐
       plied by the system.  That [4mman[24m supported the macros listed in this page
       not described as extensions, except [1m.P [22mand the deprecated [1m.AT [22mand  [1m.UC[22m.
       The only strings defined were [1mR [22mand [1mS[22m; no registers were documented.

       [1m.UC  [22mappeared in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced [1m.P [22mand
       exposed the registers [1mIN [22mand [1mLL[22m, which had  been  internal  to  Seventh
       Edition  Unix  [4mman[24m.   PWB/UNIX  2.0  (1980)  added the [1mTm [22mstring.  4BSD
       (1980) added [1mlq [22mand [1mrq [22mstrings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985) recognized [1mC[22m,  [1mD[22m,  [1mP[22m,
       and  [1mX  [22mregisters.   4.3BSD (1986) added [1m.AT [22mand [1m.P[22m.  Ninth Edition Re‐
       search Unix (1986) introduced [1m.EX [22mand [1m.EE[22m.  SunOS 4.0 (1988) added [1m.SB[22m.

       The foregoing features were what James Clark implemented in early  ver‐
       sions  of  [4mgroff[24m.   Later,  [4mgroff[24m  1.20 (2009) originated [1m.SY[22m/[1m.YS[22m, [1m.TQ[22m,
       [1m.MT[22m/[1m.ME[22m, and [1m.UR[22m/[1m.UE[22m.  Plan 9 from User Space’s [4mtroff[24m introduced [1m.MR [22min
       2020.

[1mOptions[0m
       The  following  [4mgroff[24m options set registers (with [1m-r[22m) and strings (with
       [1m-d[22m) recognized and used by the [4mman[24m macro package.  To ensure  rendering
       consistent  with output device capabilities and reader preferences, man
       pages should never manipulate them.

       [1m-dAD=[4m[22madjustment‐mode[0m
              Set line adjustment to [4madjustment‐mode,[24m which is  typically  “[1mb[22m”
              for  adjustment  to  both margins (the default), or “[1ml[22m” for left
              alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid argument to  [4mgroff[24m’s
              “.ad”  request  may  be  used.   See  [4mgroff[24m(7)  for  less‐common
              choices.

       [1m-rcR=1 [22mEnable continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated;  instead,
              one  (potentially  very long) page is produced.  This is the de‐
              fault for terminal and HTML devices.  Use [1m-rcR=0 [22mto  disable  it
              on terminal devices; on HTML devices, it cannot be disabled.

       [1m-rC1   [22mNumber  output  pages  consecutively, in strictly increasing se‐
              quence, rather than resetting the page number to 1 (or the value
              of register [1mP[22m) with each new [4mman[24m document.

       [1m-rCS=1 [22mSet  section headings (the argument(s) to [1m.SH[22m) in full capitals.
              This transformation is off by default because it  discards  case
              distinction information.

       [1m-rCT=1 [22mSet the man page topic (the first argument to [1m.TH[22m) in full capi‐
              tals in headers and footers.  This transformation is off by  de‐
              fault because it discards case distinction information.

       [1m-rD1   [22mEnable  double‐sided layout, formatting footers for even and odd
              pages differently; see the  description  of  [1m.TH  [22min  subsection
              “Document structure macros” above.

       [1m-rFT=[4m[22mfooter‐distance[0m
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the page to
              [4mfooter‐distance;[24m this amount is always negative.  At  one  half‐
              inch above this location, the page text is broken before writing
              the footer.  Ignored if continuous rendering  is  enabled.   The
              default is -0.5i.

       [1m-dHF=[4m[22mheading‐font[0m
              Set  the  font used for section and subsection headings; the de‐
              fault is “[1mB[22m” (bold style of the default family).  Any valid  ar‐
              gument to [4mgroff[24m’s “.ft” request may be used.  See [4mgroff[24m(7).

       [1m-rHY=0 [22mDisable  automatic  hyphenation.   Normally,  it is enabled (1).
              The hyphenation mode is determined by the [4mgroff[24m locale; see sec‐
              tion “Localization“ of [4mgroff[24m(7).

       [1m-rIN=[4m[22mstandard‐indentation[0m
              Set  the  amount of indentation used for ordinary paragraphs ([1m.P[0m
              and its synonyms) and the default  indentation  amount  used  by
              [1m.IP[22m, [1m.RS[22m, [1m.TP[22m, and the deprecated [1m.HP[22m.  See subsection “Horizon‐
              tal and vertical spacing” above for the default.   For  terminal
              devices, [4mstandard‐indentation[24m should always be an integer multi‐
              ple of unit “n” to get consistent indentation.

       [1m-rLL=[4m[22mline‐length[0m
              Set line length; the default is 78n  for  terminal  devices  and
              6.5i for typesetting devices.

       [1m-rLT=[4m[22mtitle‐length[0m
              Set  the line length for titles.  (“Titles” is the [4mroff[24m term for
              headers and footers.)  By default, it is set to the line  length
              (see [1m-rLL [22mabove).

       [1m-dMF=[4m[22mman‐page‐topic‐font[0m
              Set  the  font  used  for  man  page topics named in [1m.TH [22mand [1m.MR[0m
              calls; the default is “[1mI[22m” (italic style of the default  family).
              Any valid argument to [4mgroff[24m’s “.ft” request may be used.  If the
              [1mMF [22mstring ends in “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique  typeface,
              and  italic  corrections  are  applied before and after man page
              topics.

       [1m-rP[4m[22mn[24m   Start enumeration of pages at [4mn[24m.  The default is 1.

       [1m-rS[4m[22mtype‐size[0m
              Use [4mtype‐size[24m for the document’s body  text;  acceptable  values
              are  10,  11,  or 12 points.  See subsection “Font style macros”
              above for the default.

       [1m-rSN=[4m[22msubsection‐indentation[0m
              Set indentation of subsection  headings  to  [4msubsection‐indenta‐[0m
              [4mtion.[24m   See  subsection  “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above
              for the default.

       [1m-rU1   [22mEnable generation of URI hyperlinks in the  [4mgrohtml[24m  and  [4mgrotty[0m
              output  drivers.   [4mgrohtml[24m  enables them by default; [4mgrotty[24m does
              not, pending more widespread pager support for OSC 8 escape  se‐
              quences.  Use [1m-rU0 [22mto disable hyperlinks; this will make the ar‐
              guments to [1mMT [22mand [1mUR [22mcalls visible in the document text produced
              by link‐capable drivers.

       [1m-rX[4m[22mp[24m   Number  successors  of  page [4mp[24m as [4mp[24ma, [4mp[24mb, [4mp[24mc, and so forth.  The
              register tracking the suffixed page letter uses format “a”  (see
              the  “.af”  request  in [4mgroff[24m(7)).  For example, the option [1m-rX2[0m
              produces the following page numbers: 1, 2,  2a,  2b,  ...,  2aa,

              package  is being used by a document and loads the correct macro
              definitions, taking advantage of the fact that pages using  them
              must  call [1m.TH [22mor [1m.Dd[22m, respectively, before any other macros.  A

              need  not know which package the file [4mpage.1[24m uses.  Multiple man
              pages, in either format, can  be  handled;  [4mandoc[24m  reloads  each
              macro package as necessary.

       [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an-ext.tmac[0m
              Except  for [1m.SB[22m, definitions of macros described above as exten‐
              sions are contained in this file; in some cases, they  are  sim‐
              pler  versions  of definitions appearing in [4man.tmac[24m, and are ig‐
              nored if the formatter is GNU [4mtroff[24m.  They  are  written  to  be
              compatible  with  AT&T [4mtroff[24m and permissively licensed—not copy‐
              lefted.  To reduce the risk of name space collisions, string and
              register  names  begin only with “[1mm[22m”[1m.  [22mWe encourage man page au‐
              thors who are concerned about portability to legacy Unix systems

              On devices with large glyph repertoires, like UTF‐8‐capable ter‐
              minals and PDF, several  keyboard  glyphs  are  mapped  to  code
              points  outside  the Unicode basic Latin range because that usu‐
              ally results in better typography in  the  general  case.   When
              documenting  GNU/Linux  command  or  C language syntax, however,
              this translation is sometimes not desirable.

              To get a “literal”...   ...should be input.

              Additionally, if a neutral double quote (") is needed in a macro
              argument,  you  can use [1m\(dq [22mto get it.  You should [4mnot[24m use [1m\(aq[0m
              for an ordinary apostrophe (as in “can’t”) or [1m\- [22mfor an ordinary
              hyphen  (as in “word‐aligned”).  Review subsection “Portability”
              above.

       • Do I ever need to use an empty macro argument ("")?
              Probably not.  When this seems necessary,  often  a  shorter  or
              clearer alternative is available.

                     Instead of...               ...should be considered.

              In the title heading ([1m.TH[22m), the date of the page’s last revision
              is more important than packaging information; it should  not  be
              omitted.  Ideally, a page maintainer will keep both up to date.

              [1m.IP  [22mis sometimes ill‐understood and misused, especially when no
              marker argument is supplied—an indentation argument is  not  re‐
              quired.  By setting an explicit indentation, you may be overrid‐
              ing the reader’s preference as set with  the  [1m-rIN  [22moption.   If
              your  page renders adequately without one, use the simpler form.
              If you need to indent multiple (unmarked)  paragraphs,  consider
              setting an inset region with [1m.RS [22mand [1m.RE [22minstead.

              In  the last example, the empty argument does have a subtly dif‐
              ferent effect than its suggested replacement: the empty argument
              causes  an additional space character to be interpolated between
              the arguments “two” and “three”—but it  is  a  regular  breaking
              space,  so it can be discarded at the end of an output line.  It
              is better not to be subtle, particularly with space,  which  can
              be overlooked in source and rendered forms.

       • [1m.RS [22mdoesn’t indent relative to my indented paragraph.
              The  [1m.RS  [22mmacro  sets  the left margin; that is, the position at
              which an [4mordinary[24m paragraph ([1m.P [22mand its synonyms) will  be  set.
              [1m.IP[22m,  [1m.TP[22m,  and the deprecated [1m.HP [22muse the same default indenta‐
              tion.  If not given an argument, [1m.RS [22mmoves the  left  margin  by
              this  same  amount.   To create an inset relative to an indented
              paragraph, call [1m.RS [22mrepeatedly until an  acceptable  indentation
              is  achieved,  or  give  [1m.RS  [22man indentation argument that is at
              least as much as the paragraph’s indentation amount relative  to
              an adjacent [1m.P [22mparagraph.  See subsection “Horizontal and verti‐
              cal spacing” above for the values.

              Another approach you can use with tagged paragraphs is to  place
              an  [1m.RS [22mcall immediately after the paragraph tag; this will also
              force a break regardless of the width of the tag, which some au‐
              thors  prefer.   Follow‐up  paragraphs under the tag can then be
              set with [1m.P [22minstead of [1m.IP[22m.  Remember to use [1m.RE [22mto end the  in‐
              dented  region before starting the next tagged paragraph (at the
              appropriate nesting level).

       • [1m.RE [22mdoesn’t move the inset back to the expected level.

              level  of the first [1m.RS [22mcall you made, and so forth.  If you de‐
              sire symmetry in your macro calls, simply issue one [1m.RE  [22mwithout
              an argument for each [1m.RS [22mthat precedes it.

              After  calls  to the [1m.SH [22mand [1m.SS [22msectioning macros, all relative
              insets are cleared and calls to [1m.RE [22mhave no effect until [1m.RS  [22mis
              used again.

       • Do I need to keep typing the indentation in a series of [1m.IP [22mcalls?
              Not if you don’t want to change it.  Review subsection “Horizon‐
              tal and vertical spacing” above.

       • Why doesn’t the package provide a string to insert an ellipsis?
              Examples of ellipsis usage are shown above, in subsection  “Com‐
              mand  synopsis  macros”.   The  idiomatic [4mroff[24m ellipsis is three
              dots (periods) with thin space escape  sequences  [1m\|  [22minternally
              separating  them.   Since  dots both begin control lines and are
              candidate end‐of‐sentence characters, however, it  is  sometimes
              necessary  to  prefix  and/or  suffix an ellipsis with the dummy
              character escape sequence [1m\&[22m.  That fact stands even if a string
              is  defined to contain the sequence; further, if the string ends
              with [1m\&[22m, end‐of‐sentence detection is defeated when you use  the
              string  at  the  end  of an actual sentence.  (Ending a sentence
              with an ellipsis is often poor style, but not always.)  A  hypo‐
              thetical  string  [1mEL  [22mthat  contained  an  ellipsis, but not the
              trailing dummy character [1m\&[22m, would then need to be suffixed with
              the latter when not ending a sentence.

                  Instead of...              ...do this.

              The  first column practices a false economy; the savings in typ‐
              ing is offset by the cost of obscuring even the suggestion of an
              ellipsis  to a casual reader of the source document, and reduced
              portability to non‐[4mroff[24m man page formatters that  cannot  handle
              string definitions.

              There  is an ellipsis code point in Unicode, and some fonts have
              an ellipsis glyph, which some man pages have accessed in a  non‐
              portable  way  with  the  font‐dependent [1m\N [22mescape sequence.  We
              discourage the use of these; on terminals, they  may  crowd  the
              dots  into  a  half‐width character cell, and will not render at
              all if the output device doesn’t have the glyph.  In syntax syn‐
              opses,  missing  ellipses  can  cause great confusion.  Dots and
              space are universally supported.

       The initial GNU implementation of the [4mman[24m macro package was written  by
       James  Clark.   Later, Werner Lemberg supplied the [1mS[22m, [1mLT[22m, and [1mcR [22mregis‐
       ters, the last a 4.3BSD‐Reno [4mmdoc[24m(7) feature.  Larry Kollar  added  the

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  implementation  of  the  [4mmdoc[24m  macro  package  is part of the
       [4mgroff[24m(1) document formatting system.  [4mmdoc[24m is a structurally‐  and  se‐
       mantically‐oriented   package   for  writing  Unix  manual  pages  with
       [4mtroff[24m(1).  Its predecessor, the  [4mman[24m(7)  package,  primarily  addressed
       page layout and presentational concerns, leaving the selection of fonts
       and other typesetting details to the individual author.   This  discre‐
       tion has led to divergent styling practices among authors using it.

       [4mmdoc[24m organizes its macros into [4mdomains[24m.  The [4mpage[24m [4mstructure[24m [4mdomain[24m lays
       out the page and comprises  titles,  section  headings,  displays,  and
       lists.  The [4mgeneral[24m [4mtext[24m [4mdomain[24m supplies macros to quote or style text,
       or to interpolate common noun phrases.  The [4mmanual[24m [4mdomain[24m offers seman‐
       tic  macros  corresponding  to the terminology used by practitioners in
       discussion of Unix commands, routines, and files.  Manual domain macros
       distinguish  command‐line  arguments and options, function names, func‐
       tion parameters, pathnames, variables, cross references to other manual
       pages,  and  so  on.  These terms are meaningful both to the author and
       the readers of a manual page.  It is hoped that the resulting increased
       consistency  of  the  man page corpus will enable easier translation to
       future documentation tools.

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to simply  as
       a  “man  page”, regardless of its length, without gendered implication,
       and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.

[1mGetting started[0m
       The [4mmdoc[24m package attempts to simplify man page authorship  and  mainte‐
       nance  without  requiring  mastery of the [4mroff[24m language.  This document
       presents only essential facts about [4mroff.[24m For further  background,  in‐
       cluding  a  discussion of basic typographical concepts like “breaking”,
       “filling”, and “adjustment”, see [4mroff[24m(7).  Specialized  units  of  mea‐
       surement  also arise, namely ens, vees, inches, and points, abbreviated
       “n”, “v”, “i”, and “p”, respectively;  see  section  “Measurements”  of
       [4mgroff[24m(7).

       For  brief  examples, we employ an arrow notation illustrating a trans‐
       formation of input on the left to rendered output on the  right.   Con‐
       sider the .[1mDq [22mmacro, which double‐quotes its arguments.
             [1m.Dq man page  [22m→ “man page”

   [1mUsage[0m
       An  [4mmdoc[24m  [4mmacro[24m  is  [4mcalled[24m  by placing the [4mroff[24m control character, ‘.’
       (dot) at the beginning of a line followed by its name.  In  this  docu‐
       ment,  we  often discuss a macro name with this leading dot to identify
       it clearly, but the dot is [4mnot[24m part of its name.  Space or tab  charac‐
       ters  can  separate the dot from the macro name.  Arguments may follow,
       separated from the macro name and each other by spaces, but  [4mnot[24m  tabs.
       The dot at the beginning of the line prepares the formatter to expect a
       macro name.  A dot followed immediately by a newline is  ignored;  this
       is  called  the [4mempty[24m [4mrequest[24m.  To begin an input line with a dot (or a
       neutral apostrophe ‘'’) in some context other than a macro  call,  pre‐
       cede  it  with the ‘\&’ escape sequence; this is a dummy character, not
       formatted for output.  The backslash is the [4mroff[24m escape  character;  it
       can appear anywhere and it always followed by at least one more charac‐
       ter.  If followed by a newline, the backslash escapes  the  input  line
       break; you can thus keep input lines to a reasonable length without af‐
       fecting their interpretation.

       Macros in GNU [4mtroff[24m accept an unlimited number of  arguments,  in  con‐
       trast  to other [4mtroff[24ms that often can’t handle more than nine.  In lim‐
       ited cases, arguments may be continued or extended on  the  next  input
       line  without  resort to the ‘\[4mnewline[24m’ escape sequence; see subsection
       “Extended arguments” below.  Neutral double quotes [1m"  [22mcan  be  used  to
       group  multiple  words  into an argument; see subsection “Passing space
       characters in an argument” below.

       Most of [4mmdoc[24m’s general text and manual domain macros [4mparse[24m their  argu‐
       ment  lists  for  [4mcallable[24m macro names.  This means that an argument in
       the list matching a general text or manual domain macro name  (and  de‐
       fined  to be callable) will be called with the remaining arguments when
       it is encountered.  In such cases, the argument, although the name of a
       macro, is not preceded by a dot.  Macro calls can thus be nested.  This
       approach to macro argument processing is a unique characteristic of the
       [4mmdoc[24m package, not a general feature of [4mroff[24m syntax.

       For  example,  the  option  macro,  .[1mOp[22m, may call the flag and argument
       macros, .[1mFl [22mand .[1mAr[22m, to specify an optional flag with an argument.
             [1m.Op Fl s Ar bytes      [22m→ [[1m-s [4m[22mbytes[24m]
       To prevent a word from being interpreted as a macro  name,  precede  it
       with the dummy character.
             [1m.Op \&Fl s \&Ar bytes  [22m→ [Fl s Ar bytes]

       In  this  document, macros whose argument lists are parsed for callable
       arguments are referred to as [4mparsed[24m, and those that may be called  from
       an  argument list are referred to as [4mcallable[24m.  This usage is a techni‐
       cal [4mfaux[24m [4mpas[24m, since all [4mmdoc[24m macros are  in  fact  interpreted  (unless
       prevented  with  ‘\&’),  but as it is cumbersome to constantly refer to
       macros as “being able  to  call  other  macros”,  we  employ  the  term
       “parsed”  instead.  Except where explicitly stated, all [4mmdoc[24m macros are
       parsed and callable.

       In the following, we term an [4mmdoc[24m macro that  starts  a  line  (with  a
       leading  dot)  a [4mcommand[24m if a distinction from those appearing as argu‐
       ments of other macros is necessary.

   [1mPassing space characters in an argument[0m
       Sometimes it is desirable to give a macro an argument containing one or
       more space characters, for instance to specify a particular arrangement
       of arguments demanded by the macro.  Additionally,  quoting  multi‐word
       arguments  that  are  to  be  treated  the same makes [4mmdoc[24m work faster;
       macros that parse arguments do so once (at most) for each.   For  exam‐
       ple, the function command .[1mFn [22mexpects its first argument to be the name
       of a function and any remaining arguments to  be  function  parameters.
       Because C language standards mandate the inclusion of types [4mand[24m identi‐
       fiers in the parameter lists of function definitions, each ‘Fn’ parame‐
       ter  after  the  first will be at least two words in length, as in “[4mint[0m
       [4mfoo[24m”.

       There are a few ways to embed a space in a macro argument.  One  is  to
       use  the  unadjustable  space  escape  sequence  [1m\[4m[22mspace[24m.  The formatter
       treats this escape sequence as if it were any other  printable  charac‐
       ter,  and will not break a line there as it would a word space when the
       output line is full.  This method is useful for  macro  arguments  that
       are  not  expected to straddle an output line boundary, but has a draw‐
       back: this space does not adjust as others do when the output  line  is
       formatted.   An  alternative is to use the unbreakable space escape se‐
       quence, ‘\~’, which cannot break but does adjust.  This [4mgroff[24m extension
       is widely but not perfectly portable.  Another method is to enclose the
       string in double quotes.
             [1m.Fn fetch char\ *str   [22m→ [1mfetch[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*str[24m)
             [1m.Fn fetch char\~*str   [22m→ [1mfetch[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*str[24m)
             [1m.Fn fetch "char *str"  [22m→ [1mfetch[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*str[24m)
       If the ‘\’ before the space in the first example or the  double  quotes
       in the third example were omitted, ‘.Fn’ would see three arguments, and
       the result would contain an undesired comma.
             [1m.Fn fetch char *str    [22m→ [1mfetch[22m([4mchar[24m, [4m*str[24m)

   [1mTrailing space characters[0m
       It is wise to remove trailing spaces from  the  ends  of  input  lines.
       Should  the need arise to put a formattable space at the end of a line,
       do so with the unadjustable or unbreakable space escape sequences.

   [1mFormatting the backslash glyph[0m
       When you need the [4mroff[24m escape character ‘\’ to appear  in  the  output,
       use  ‘\e’ or ‘\(rs’ instead.  Technically, ‘\e’ formats the current es‐
       cape character; it works reliably as long as no [4mroff[24m request is used to
       change  it,  which should never happen in man pages.  ‘\(rs’ is a [4mgroff[0m
       special character escape sequence that explicitly formats the  “reverse
       solidus” (backslash) glyph.

   [1mOther possible pitfalls[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  [4mmdoc[24m  warns  when  an  empty  input  line  is found outside of a
       [4mdisplay[24m, a topic presented in subsection “Examples and displays” below.
       Use empty requests to space the source document for maintenance.

       Leading  spaces  cause a break and are formatted.  Avoid this behaviour
       if possible.  Similarly, do not put more than one space  between  words
       in  an  ordinary text line; they are not “normalized” to a single space
       as other text formatters might do.

       Don’t try to use the neutral double quote character  ‘"’  to  represent
       itself  in  an  argument.   Use  the  special character escape sequence
       ‘\(dq’ to format it.  Further, this glyph should not be used  for  con‐
       ventional quotation; [4mmdoc[24m offers several quotation macros.  See subsec‐
       tion “Enclosure and quoting macros” below.

       The formatter attempts to detect the ends of sentences and  by  default
       puts  the equivalent of two spaces between sentences on the same output
       line; see [4mroff[24m(7).  To defeat this detection in a parsed list of  macro
       arguments, put ‘\&’ before the punctuation mark.  Thus,
             The
             .Ql .
             character.
             .Pp

       as  output.   As  can be seen in the first and third output lines, [4mmdoc[0m
       handles punctuation characters specially in macro arguments.  This will
       be explained in section “General syntax” below.

       A  comment in the source file of a man page can begin with ‘[1m.\"[22m’ at the
       start of an input line, ‘[1m\"[22m’ after other input, or ‘[1m\#[22m’  anywhere  (the
       last is a [4mgroff[24m extension); the remainder of any such line is ignored.

       The  first  items  in  the template are the commands .[1mDd[22m, .[1mDt[22m, and .[1mOs[22m.
       They identify the page  and  are  discussed  below  in  section  “Title
       macros”.

       The  remaining  items  in  the  template are section headings (.[1mSh[22m); of
       which “Name” and “Description” are mandatory.  These headings are  dis‐
       cussed  in  section  “Page  structure  domain”,  which  follows section
       “Manual domain”.  Familiarize yourself with manual domain macros first;
       we use them to illustrate the use of page structure domain macros.

[1mConventions[0m
       In  the descriptions of macros below, square brackets surround optional
       arguments.  An ellipsis (‘...’) represents repetition of the  preceding
       argument  zero  or  more  times.  Alternative values of a parameter are
       separated with ‘|’.  If a mandatory parameter can take one  of  several
       alternative  values, use braces to enclose the set, with spaces and ‘|’
       separating the items.
             [1mztar [22m{[1mc [22m| [1mx[22m} [[1m-w [22m[[1m-y [22m| [1m-z[22m]] [[1m-f [4m[22marchive[24m] [4mmember[24m ...
       An alternative to using braces is to separately synopsize distinct  op‐
       eration  modes, particularly if the list of valid optional arguments is
       dependent on the user’s choice of a mandatory parameter.
             [1mztar c [22m[[1m-w [22m[[1m-y [22m| [1m-z[22m]] [[1m-f [4m[22marchive[24m] [4mmember[24m ...
             [1mztar x [22m[[1m-w [22m[[1m-y [22m| [1m-z[22m]] [[1m-f [4m[22marchive[24m] [4mmember[24m ...

       Most macros affect subsequent arguments until another macro or  a  new‐
       line  is encountered.  For example, ‘[1m.Li ls Bq Ar file[22m’ doesn’t produce
       ‘[1mls [file][22m’, but ‘[1mls [22m[[4mfile[24m]’.  Consequently, a warning message is emit‐
       ted for many commands if the first argument is itself a macro, since it
       cancels the effect of the preceding one.  On rare occasions, you  might
       want to format a word along with surrounding brackets as a literal.
             [1m.Li "ls [file]"  [22m→ [1mls [file] [4m[22m#[24m [4mlist[24m [4many[24m [4mfiles[24m [4mnamed[24m [4me,[24m [4mf,[24m [4mi,[24m [4mor[24m [4ml[0m

       Many  macros possess an implicit width, used when they are contained in
       lists and displays.  If you avoid relying  on  these  default  measure‐
       ments,  you escape potential conflicts with site‐local modifications of
       the [4mmdoc[24m package.  Explicit [1m-width [22mand [1m-offset [22marguments to the .[1mBl [22mand
       .[1mBd [22mmacros are preferable.

[1mTitle macros[0m
       We  present  the  [1mmandatory  [22mtitle macros first due to their importance
       even though they formally belong to the page structure  domain  macros.
       They designate the topic, date of last revision, and the operating sys‐
       tem or software project associated with the page.  Call  each  once  at
       the  beginning  of  the  document.   They populate the page headers and
       footers, which are in [4mroff[24m parlance termed “titles”.

       [1m.Dd [4m[22mdate[0m
               This first macro of any [4mmdoc[24m manual records the last  modifica‐
               tion  date  of the document source.  Arguments are concatenated
               and separated with space characters.

               Historically, [4mdate[24m was  written  in  U.S.  traditional  format,
               “[4mMonth[24m  [4mday[24m  , [4myear[24m” where [4mMonth[24m is the full month name in Eng‐
               lish, [4mday[24m an integer without a leading zero, and [4myear[24m the four‐
               digit  year.   This localism is not enforced, however.  You may
               prefer  ISO  8601  format,  [4mYYYY‐MM‐DD.[24m  A  [4mdate[24m  of  the  form
               ‘[1m$Mdocdate:  [4m[22mMonth[24m  [4mday[24m [4myear[24m [1m$[22m’ is also recognized.  It is used
               in OpenBSD manuals to automatically  insert  the  current  date
               when committing.

               This macro is neither callable nor parsed.

       [1m.Dt [4m[22mtopic[24m [[4msection‐identifier[24m [[4msection‐keyword‐or‐title[24m]]
               [4mtopic[24m  is  the  subject  of the man page.  A [4msection‐identifier[0m
               that begins with an integer in the range 1–9 or is one  of  the
               words ‘unass’, ‘draft’, or ‘paper’ selects a predefined section
               title.  This use of “section” has nothing to do with  the  sec‐
               tion  headings otherwise discussed in this page; it arises from
               the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix manuals.

               In this implementation, the following titles  are  defined  for
               integral section numbers.

                     1   General Commands Manual
                     2   System Calls Manual

                     8   System Manager’s Manual
                     9   Kernel Developer’s Manual

               A section title may be arbitrary or one of the following abbre‐
               viations.

                     USD     User’s Supplementary Documents
                     PS1     Programmer’s Supplementary Documents

               For compatibility, ‘MMI’ can be used for ‘IND’, and  ‘LOC’  for
               ‘LOCAL’.   Values  from  the  previous table will specify a new
               section title.  If [4msection‐keyword‐or‐title[24m designates  a  com‐
               puter  architecture  recognized  by  [4mgroff[24m  [4mmdoc[24m,  its value is
               prepended to the default section title as specified by the sec‐
               ond parameter.  By default, the following architecture keywords
               are defined.

                   acorn26, acorn32, algor, alpha, amd64, amiga, amigappc,

               If  a  section  title is not determined after the above matches
               have been attempted, [4msection‐keyword‐or‐title[24m is used.

               The effects of varying ‘.Dt’ arguments on the page header  con‐
               tent  are shown below.  Observe how ‘\&’ prevents the numeral 2
               from being used to look up a predefined section title.

                 .Dt foo 2       →  foo(2)     System Calls Manual      foo(2)
                 .Dt foo 2 m68k  →  foo(2)   m68k System Calls Manual   foo(2)
                 .Dt foo 2 baz   →  foo(2)     System Calls Manual      foo(2)
                 .Dt foo \&2 baz →  foo(2)             baz              foo(2)
                 .Dt foo "" baz  →  foo                baz                 foo

               ture  for the software specified.  In the following table, rec‐
               ognized [4mversion‐or‐release[24m arguments for some predefined  oper‐

               Historically,  the first argument used with .[1mDt [22mwas [1mBSD [22mor [1mATT[22m.
               An unrecognized version argument after  [1mATT  [22mis  replaced  with
               “Unix”; for other predefined abbreviations, it is ignored and a
               warning diagnostic emitted.  Otherwise, unrecognized  arguments
               are  displayed verbatim in the page footer.  For instance, this
               page uses “[1m.Os groff 1.23.0[22m” whereas a  locally  produced  page
               might employ “[1m.Os "UXYZ CS Department"[22m”, omitting versioning.

               This macro is neither callable nor parsed.

[1mIntroduction to manual and general text domains[0m
   [1mWhat’s in a Name[22m...
       The  manual domain macro names are derived from the day to day informal
       language used to describe  commands,  subroutines  and  related  files.
       Slightly different variations of this language are used to describe the
       three different aspects of writing a man page.  First, there is the de‐
       scription  of [4mmdoc[24m macro command usage.  Second is the description of a
       Unix command [4mwith[24m [4mmdoc[24m macros, and third, the description of a  command
       to  a user in the verbal sense; that is, discussion of a command in the
       text of a man page.

       In the first case, [4mtroff[24m macros are themselves a type of  command;  the
       general syntax for a [4mtroff[24m command is:

             [1m.Xx argument1 argument2 ...[0m

       ‘.Xx’ is a macro command, and anything following it are arguments to be
       processed.  In the second case, the description of a Unix command using
       the  manual  domain macros is a bit more involved; a typical “Synopsis”
       command line might be displayed as:

             [1mfilter [22m[[1m-flag[22m] ⟨[4minfile[24m⟩ ⟨[4moutfile[24m⟩

       Here, [1mfilter [22mis the command name and the bracketed string  [1m-flag  [22mis  a
       [4mflag[24m  argument  designated as optional by the option brackets.  In [4mmdoc[0m
       terms, ⟨[4minfile[24m⟩ and ⟨[4moutfile[24m⟩ are called [4mmeta[24m [4marguments[24m; in this  exam‐
       ple, the user has to replace the meta expressions given in angle brack‐
       ets with real file names.  Note that in this  document  meta  arguments
       are  used  to describe [4mmdoc[24m commands; in most man pages, meta variables
       are not specifically written with angle brackets.  The macros that for‐
       matted the above example:

             .Nm filter
             .Op Fl flag
             .Ao Ar infile Ac Ao Ar outfile Ac

       In  the  third case, discussion of commands and command syntax includes
       both examples above, but may add more detail.  The  arguments  ⟨[4minfile[24m⟩
       and  ⟨[4moutfile[24m⟩  from the example above might be referred to as [4moperands[0m
       or [4mfile[24m [4marguments[24m.  Some command‐line argument lists are quite long:

             [1mmake  [22m[[1m-eiknqrstv[22m] [[1m-D [4m[22mvariable[24m] [[1m-d [4m[22mflags[24m] [[1m-f [4m[22mmakefile[24m] [[1m-I[0m
                   [4mdirectory[24m] [[1m-j [4m[22mmax_jobs[24m] [[4mvariable[24m=[4mvalue[24m] [[4mtarget[24m ...]

       Here  one  might  talk about the command [4mmake[24m and qualify the argument,
       [4mmakefile[24m, as an argument to the flag, [1m-f[22m, or discuss the optional  file
       operand  [4mtarget[24m.  In the verbal context, such detail can prevent confu‐
       sion, however the [4mmdoc[24m package does not have a macro for an argument [4mto[0m
       a flag.  Instead the ‘Ar’ argument macro is used for an operand or file
       argument like [4mtarget[24m as well as an argument to a  flag  like  [4mvariable[24m.
       The make command line was produced from:

             .Nm make
             .Op Fl eiknqrstv
             .Op Fl D Ar variable
             .Op Fl d Ar flags
             .Op Fl f Ar makefile
             .Op Fl I Ar directory
             .Op Fl j Ar max_jobs
             .Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
             .Bk
             .Op Ar target ...
             .Ek

       The ‘.Bk’ and ‘.Ek’ macros are explained in “Keeps”.

   [1mGeneral Syntax[0m
       The manual domain and general text domain macros share a similar syntax
       with a few minor deviations; most notably,  ‘.Ar’,  ‘.Fl’,  ‘.Nm’,  and
       ‘.Pa’  differ  only  when called without arguments; and ‘.Fn’ and ‘.Xr’
       impose an order on their argument lists.  All manual domain macros  are
       capable of recognizing and properly handling punctuation, provided each
       punctuation character is separated by a leading space.  If a command is
       given:

             [1m.Ar sptr, ptr),[0m

       The result is:

             [4msptr,[24m [4mptr),[0m

       The punctuation is not recognized and all is output in the font used by
       ‘.Ar’.  If the punctuation is separated by a leading white space:

             [1m.Ar sptr , ptr ) ,[0m

       The result is:

             [4msptr[24m, [4mptr[24m),

       The punctuation is now recognized and output in the default  font  dis‐
       tinguishing  it from the argument strings.  To remove the special mean‐
       ing from a punctuation character, escape it with ‘\&’.

       The following punctuation characters are recognized by [4mmdoc[24m:

                 [1m.         ,         :         ;         ([0m
                 [1m)         [         ]         ?         ![0m

       [4mtroff[24m is limited as a macro language, and has difficulty when presented
       with  a  string  containing certain mathematical, logical, or quotation
       character sequences:

                   {+,-,/,*,%,<,>,<=,>=,=,==,&,`,',"}

       The problem is that [4mtroff[24m may assume it is supposed to actually perform
       the  operation  or  evaluation suggested by the characters.  To prevent
       the accidental evaluation of these characters, escape them  with  ‘\&’.
       Typical  syntax is shown in the first manual domain macro displayed be‐
       low, ‘.Ad’.

[1mManual domain[0m
   [1mAddresses[0m
       The address macro identifies an address construct.

             [1mUsage: .Ad [22m⟨address⟩ ...

                      [1m.Ad addr1           [4m[22maddr1[0m
                      [1m.Ad addr1 .         [4m[22maddr1[24m.
                      [1m.Ad addr1 , file2   [4m[22maddr1[24m, [4mfile2[0m
                      [1m.Ad f1 , f2 , f3 :  [4m[22mf1[24m, [4mf2[24m, [4mf3[24m:
                      [1m.Ad addr ) ) ,      [4m[22maddr[24m)),

       The default width is 12n.

   [1mAuthor Name[0m
       The ‘.An’ macro is used to specify the name of the author of  the  item
       being documented, or the name of the author of the actual manual page.

             [1mUsage: .An [22m⟨author name⟩ ...

                      [1m.An "Joe Author"        [22mJoe Author

                      [1m.An "Joe Author" ,      [22mJoe Author,

                      [1m.An "Joe Author" Aq nobody@FreeBSD.org[0m
                                              Joe Author <nobody@FreeBSD.org>

                      [1m.An "Joe Author" ) ) ,  [22mJoe Author)),

       The default width is 12n.

       In  a  section titled “Authors”, ‘An’ causes a break, allowing each new
       name to appear on its own line.  If this is not desirable,

             .An -nosplit

       call will turn this off.  To turn splitting back on, write

             .An -split

   [1mArguments[0m
       The [1m.Ar [22margument macro may be used whenever an argument is  referenced.
       If called without arguments, ‘[4mfile[24m [4m...[24m’ is output.  This places the el‐
       lipsis in italics, which is ugly and incorrect, and will be noticed  on

   [1mCommand Modifiers[0m
       The command modifier is identical to the ‘.Fl’ (flag) command with  the
       exception that the ‘.Cm’ macro does not assert a dash in front of every
       argument.  Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding  dash,  how‐
       ever,  some  commands  or subsets of commands do not use them.  Command
       modifiers may also be specified in conjunction  with  interactive  com‐
       mands such as editor commands.  See “Flags”.

       to the flag.  For interactive command flags that are not prepended with
       a  dash,  the  ‘.Cm’ (command modifier) macro is identical, but without
       the dash.

       The ‘.Fl’ macro without any arguments results in  a  dash  representing
       stdin/stdout.   Note that giving ‘.Fl’ a single dash will result in two
       dashes.

       The default width is 12n.

   [1mFunction Declarations[0m
       The ‘.Fd’ macro is used in the “Synopsis” section with section  two  or
       three functions.  It is neither callable nor parsed.

             [1mUsage: .Fd [22m⟨argument⟩ ...

                      [1m.Fd "#include <sys/types.h>"  #include <sys/types.h>[0m

       In  a  section titled “Synopsis”, ‘Fd’ causes a break if a function has
       already been presented and a break has not occurred,  leaving  vertical
       space between one function declaration and the next.

       In  a section titled “Synopsis”, the ‘In’ macro represents the [1m#include[0m
       statement, and is the short form of the above  example.   It  specifies
       the  C  header file as being included in a C program.  It also causes a
       break.

       While not in the “Synopsis” section, it represents the header file  en‐
       closed in angle brackets.

       This macro is intended for the “Synopsis” section.  It may be used any‐
       where else in the man page without problems, but its main purpose is to
       present  the  function  type  (in  BSD  kernel  normal  form)  for  the
       “Synopsis” of sections two and three.  (It causes a break, allowing the
       function name to appear on the next line.)

       Note  that  any call to another macro signals the end of the ‘.Fn’ call
       (it will insert a closing parenthesis at that point).

       For functions with many parameters (which is rare),  the  macros  ‘.Fo’
       (function  open)  and  ‘.Fc’  (function  close)  may be used with ‘.Fa’
       (function argument).

       Example:

             .Ft int
             .Fo res_mkquery
             .Fa "int op"
             .Fa "char *dname"
             .Fa "int class"
             .Fa "int type"
             .Fa "char *data"
             .Fa "int datalen"
             .Fa "struct rrec *newrr"
             .Fa "char *buf"
             .Fa "int buflen"
             .Fc

       Produces:

             [4mint[24m [4mbuflen[24m)

       Typically, in a “Synopsis” section, the function delcaration will begin
       the  line.   If  more  than one function is presented in the “Synopsis”
       section and a function type has not been given,  a  break  will  occur,
       leaving vertical space between the current and prior function names.

       The  default  width  values of ‘.Fn’ and ‘.Fo’ are 12n and 16n, respec‐
       tively.

   [1mFunction Arguments[0m
       The ‘.Fa’ macro is used to refer  to  function  arguments  (parameters)
       outside  of  the  “Synopsis”  section  of  the  manual  or  inside  the
       “Synopsis” section if the enclosure macros ‘.Fo’ and ‘.Fc’  instead  of
       ‘.Fn’ are used.  ‘.Fa’ may also be used to refer to structure members.

   [1mReturn Values[0m
       The ‘.Rv’ macro generates text for use in the “Return values” section.

             [1mUsage: .Rv [22m[-std] [⟨function⟩ ...]

       For example, ‘.Rv -std atexit’ produces:

             The [1matexit[22m() function returns the value 0 if successful; other‐
             wise the value -1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is
             set to indicate the error.

       The  [1m-std  [22moption is valid only for manual page sections 2 and 3.  Cur‐
       rently, this macro does nothing if used without the [1m-std [22mflag.

   [1mExit Status[0m
       The ‘.Ex’ macro generates text for use in the “Diagnostics” section.

             [1mUsage: .Ex [22m[-std] [⟨utility⟩ ...]

       For example, ‘.Ex -std cat’ produces:

             The [1mcat [22mutility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

       The [1m-std [22moption is valid only for manual page  sections  1,  6  and  8.
       Currently, this macro does nothing if used without the [1m-std [22mflag.

       The  ‘Nm’ macro is used for the document title or page topic.  Upon its
       first call, it has the peculiarity of remembering its  argument,  which
       should  always  be the topic of the man page.  When subsequently called
       without arguments, ‘Nm’ regurgitates this initial  name  for  the  sole
       purpose of making less work for the author.  Use of ‘Nm’ is also appro‐
       priate when presenting a command synopsis for the topic of a  man  page
       in  section 1, 6, or 8.  Its behavior changes when presented with argu‐
       ments of various forms.

       By default, the topic is set in boldface to reflect  its  prime  impor‐
       tance  in  the  discussion.   Cross references to other man page topics
       should use ‘Xr’; including a second argument for the section number en‐
       ables  them to be hyperlinked.  By default, cross‐referenced topics are
       set in italics to avoid cluttering the page with boldface.

       The default width is 10n.

       The ‘.Op’ macro places option brackets around any  remaining  arguments
       on  the  command  line, and places any trailing punctuation outside the
       brackets.  The macros ‘.Oo’ and ‘.Oc’ (which produce an opening  and  a
       closing  option  bracket,  respectively) may be used across one or more
       lines or to specify the exact position of the closing parenthesis.

   [1mFont Mode[0m
       The ‘.Bf’ font mode must be ended with  the  ‘.Ef’  macro  (the  latter
       takes no arguments).  Font modes may be nested within other font modes.

       ‘.Bf’ has the following syntax:

             [1m.Bf [22m⟨font mode⟩

       ⟨font mode⟩ must be one of the following three types:

       Both macros are neither callable nor parsed.

   [1mEnclosure and Quoting Macros[0m
       The concept of enclosure is similar to quoting.  The  object  being  to
       enclose one or more strings between a pair of characters like quotes or
       parentheses.  The terms quoting and enclosure are used  interchangeably
       throughout this document.  Most of the one‐line enclosure macros end in
       small letter ‘q’ to give a hint of quoting, but there are a few irregu‐
       larities.   For  each  enclosure  macro, there is a pair of opening and
       closing macros that end with the lowercase letters ‘o’ and ‘c’  respec‐
       tively.

       .Sq     .So    .Sc     Single Quote              ‘string’

       All macros ending with ‘q’ and ‘o’ have a default width value of 12n.

       [1m.Eo[22m, [1m.Ec  [22mThese  macros expect the first argument to be the opening and
                 closing strings, respectively.

       [1m.Es[22m, [1m.En  [22mTo work around the nine‐argument limit in the original  [4mtroff[0m
                 program,  [4mmdoc[24m  supports  two other macros that are now obso‐
                 lete.  ‘.Es’ uses its first and second parameters as  opening
                 and  closing  marks  which are then used to enclose the argu‐
                 ments of ‘.En’.  The default width  value  is  12n  for  both
                 macros.

       [1m.Eq       [22mThe  first and second arguments of this macro are the opening
                 and closing strings respectively, followed by  the  arguments
                 to be enclosed.

       [1m.Ql       [22mThe  quoted  literal  macro  behaves differently in [4mtroff[24m and
                 [4mnroff[24m modes.  If formatted with [4mnroff[24m(1), a quoted literal is
                 always  quoted.   If  formatted  with  [4mtroff[24m, an item is only
                 quoted if the width of the item is less than three  constant‐
                 width characters.  This is to make short strings more visible
                 where the font change to literal (constant‐width) is less no‐
                 ticeable.

                 The default width is 16n.

       [1m.Pf       [22mThe  prefix macro suppresses the whitespace between its first
                 and second argument:

                       [1m.Pf ( Fa name2  [22m([4mname2[0m

                 The default width is 12n.

                 The ‘.Ns’ macro (see below)  performs  the  analogous  suffix
                 function.

       [1m.Ap       [22mThe  ‘.Ap’  macro inserts an apostrophe and exits any special
                 text modes, continuing in ‘.No’ mode.

       For a good example of nested enclosure macros,  see  the  ‘.Op’  option
       macro.   It  was  created  from the same underlying enclosure macros as
       those presented in the list above.  The ‘.Xo’ and ‘.Xc’ extended  argu‐
       ment list macros are discussed below.

   [1mNormal text macro[0m
       ‘No’ formats subsequent argument(s) normally, ending the effect of ‘Em’
       and similar.  Parsing is [4mnot[24m suppressed, so you must prefix words  like
       ‘No’ with ‘\&’ to avoid their interpretation as [4mmdoc[24m macros.

       The default width is 12n.

   [1mNo‐Space Macro[0m
       The ‘.Ns’ macro suppresses insertion of a space between the current po‐
       sition and its first parameter.  For example,  it  is  useful  for  old
       style argument lists where there is no space between the flag and argu‐
       ment:

             [1mUsage: ... [22m⟨argument⟩ Ns [⟨argument⟩] ...
                    [1m.Ns [22m⟨argument⟩ ...

       Note: The ‘.Ns’ macro always invokes the ‘.No’ macro after  eliminating
       the  space  unless another macro name follows it.  If used as a command
       (i.e., the second form above in the ‘Usage’ line), ‘.Ns’  is  identical
       to ‘.No’.

   [1m(Sub)section cross references[0m

   [1mReferences and Citations[0m

                     macro is read.

       Macros  beginning  with  ‘%’ are not callable but accept multiple argu‐
       ments in the usual way.  Only the ‘.Tn’ macro is handled properly as  a
       parameter; other macros will cause strange output.  ‘.%B’ and ‘.%T’ can
       be used outside of the ‘.Rs/.Re’ environment.

       Example:

             .Rs
             .%A "Matthew Bar"
             .%A "John Foo"

   [1mExtended Arguments[0m
       The [1m.Xo [22mand [1m.Xc [22mmacros allow one to extend an argument list on a  macro
       boundary  for  the  ‘.It’ macro (see below).  Note that [1m.Xo [22mand [1m.Xc [22mare
       implemented similarly to all other macros opening and closing an enclo‐
       sure  (without  inserting  characters, of course).  This means that the
       following is true for those macros also.

       Here is an example of ‘.Xo’ using the space mode macro to turn  spacing
       off:

             .Sm off
             .It Xo Sy I Ar operation

[1mPage structure domain[0m
   [1mSection headings[0m
       The following ‘.Sh’ section heading macros are required  in  every  man
       page.  The remaining section headings are recommended at the discretion
       of the author writing the manual page.  The ‘.Sh’ macro is  parsed  but
       not  generally  callable.   It  can be used as an argument in a call to
       ‘.Sh’ only; it then reactivates the default font for ‘.Sh’.

       The default width is 8n.

       [1m.Sh Name           [22mThe ‘.Sh Name’ macro is mandatory.   If  not  speci‐
                          fied,  headers,  footers,  and  page layout defaults
                          will not be set and things will be  rather  unpleas‐
                          ant.   The  [4mName[24m  section consists of at least three
                          items.  The first is the ‘.Nm’ name macro naming the
                          subject of the man page.  The second is the name de‐
                          scription macro, ‘.Nd’, which separates the  subject
                          name  from the third item, which is the description.
                          The description should be the most terse  and  lucid
                          possible, as the space available is small.

                          ‘.Nd’ first prints ‘-’, then all its arguments.

       [1m.Sh Library        [22mThis  section  is for section two and three function
                          calls.  It should consist of a  single  ‘.Lb’  macro
                          call; see “Library Names”.

       [1m.Sh Synopsis       [22mThe  “Synopsis”  section describes the typical usage
                          of the subject of a man page.  The  macros  required
                          are  either  ‘.Nm’,  ‘.Cd’,  or  ‘.Fn’ (and possibly
                          ‘.Fo’, ‘.Fc’, ‘.Fd’, and ‘.Ft’).  The function  name
                          macro  ‘.Fn’  is required for manual page sections 2
                          and 3; the command and general name macro  ‘.Nm’  is
                          required  for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Section 4
                          manuals require a ‘.Nm’, ‘.Fd’ or a ‘.Cd’ configura‐
                          tion  device  usage macro.  Several other macros may

                          tion 2 and 3 library functions; see “Return Values”.

       The  following  ‘.Sh’ section headings are part of the preferred manual
       page layout and must be used  appropriately  to  maintain  consistency.
       They are listed in the order in which they would be used.

                          for  most  section  1,  6  and 8 commands; see “Exit

       [1m.Sh Bugs           [22mBlatant problems with the topic go here.

       User‐specified ‘.Sh’ sections may be added; for example,  this  section
       was set with:

                      .Sh "Page structure domain"

   [1mSubsection headings[0m
       Subsection  headings  have exactly the same syntax as section headings:
       ‘.Ss’ is parsed but not generally callable.  It can be used as an argu‐
       ment  in a call to ‘.Ss’ only; it then reactivates the default font for
       ‘.Ss’.

       The default width is 8n.

   [1mParagraphs and Line Spacing[0m
       [1m.Pp  [22mThe ‘.Pp’ paragraph command may be used to specify  a  line  space
            where  necessary.   The  macro  is  not necessary after a ‘.Sh’ or
            ‘.Ss’ macro or before a ‘.Bl’ or ‘.Bd’ macro (which both assert  a
            vertical distance unless the [1m-compact [22mflag is given).

            The  macro  is neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments;
            an alternative name is ‘.Lp’.

   [1mKeeps[0m
       The only keep that is implemented at  this  time  is  for  words.   The
       macros  are  ‘.Bk’  (begin keep) and ‘.Ek’ (end keep).  The only option
       that ‘.Bk’ currently accepts is [1m-words [22m(also the  default);  this  pre‐
       vents  breaks  in  the middle of options.  In the example for [1mmake [22mcom‐
       mand‐line arguments (see “What’s in a Name”), the keep  prevents  [4mnroff[0m
       from placing the flag and the argument on separate lines.

       Neither macro is callable or parsed.

       More  work  needs  to be done on the keep macros; specifically, a [1m-line[0m
       option should be added.

   [1mExamples and Displays[0m
       There are seven types of displays.

       [1m.D1  [22m(This is D‐one.)  Display one line of indented text.   This  macro
            is parsed but not callable.

            ‘.Dl’ example macro has been used throughout this file.  It allows
            the  indentation  (display) of one line of text.  Its default font
            is set to constant width  (literal).   ‘.Dl’  is  parsed  but  not
            callable.

                  [1m% ls -ldg /usr/local/bin[0m

            The above was produced by: [1m.Dl % ls \-ldg /usr/local/bin[22m.

       [1m.Bd  [22mBegin  display.   The  ‘.Bd’  display must be ended with the ‘.Ed’
            macro.  It has the following syntax:

                                           and  perhaps may never do the right

                               If ⟨string⟩ is a valid numeric  expression  in‐

                               ‘[4mu[24m’), use that value for indentation.  The most
                               useful  scaling  indicators  are  ‘m’  and ‘n’,
                               specifying the  so‐called  [4mEm[24m  and  [4mEn[24m  [4msquare[24m.
                               This  is approximately the width of the letters
                               ‘m’ and ‘n’ respectively of  the  current  font
                               (for [4mnroff[24m output, both scaling indicators give
                               the same values).  If ⟨string⟩ isn’t a  numeric
                               expression,  it is tested whether it is an [4mmdoc[0m
                               macro name, and the default offset value  asso‐
                               ciated  with  this  macro is used.  Finally, if
                               all tests fail, the width of ⟨string⟩  (typeset
                               with  a  fixed‐width font) is taken as the off‐
                               set.

   [1mLists and Columns[0m
       There  are several types of lists which may be initiated with the ‘.Bl’
       begin‐list macro.  Items within the list are specified with  the  ‘.It’
       item  macro, and each list must end with the ‘.El’ macro.  Lists may be
       nested within themselves and within displays.  The use of  columns  in‐
       side of lists or lists inside of columns is untested.

       In addition, several list attributes may be specified such as the width
       of a tag, the list offset, and compactness (blank lines  between  items
       allowed  or disallowed).  Most of this document has been formatted with
       a tag style list ([1m-tag[22m).

       It has the following syntax forms:

             [1m.Bl [22m{-hang | -ohang | -tag | -diag | -inset} [-width ⟨string⟩]
                  [-offset ⟨string⟩] [-compact]

       [1m-column  [22mThis  list  type  generates  multiple  columns.  The number of

                ⟨[4mstringN[24m⟩ starts with a ‘.’ (dot) immediately  followed  by  a
                valid  [4mmdoc[24m  macro name, interpret ⟨[4mstringN[24m⟩ and use the width
                of the result.  Otherwise, the  width  of  ⟨[4mstringN[24m⟩  (typeset
                with a fixed‐width font) is taken as the [4mN[24mth column width.

                Each  ‘.It’  argument  is  parsed  to  make a row, each column
                within the row is a separate argument separated by  a  tab  or

                         the letters ‘m’ and ‘n’ respectively of  the  current
                         font  (for [4mnroff[24m output, both scaling indicators give
                         the same values).  If ⟨[4mstring[24m⟩ isn’t  a  numeric  ex‐
                         pression,  it  is  tested whether it is an [4mmdoc[24m macro
                         name, and the default  width  value  associated  with
                         this  macro is used.  Finally, if all tests fail, the
                         width of ⟨[4mstring[24m⟩ (typeset with a  fixed‐width  font)
                         is taken as the width.

                         If  a  width  is not specified for the tag list type,

                         scaling   indicators   give  the  same  values).   If

            ‘Fr’  allows a break right before the return value (usually a sin‐
            gle digit) which is bad typographical behaviour.  Instead, set the
            return  value with the rest of the code, using ‘\~’ to tie the re‐
            turn value to the previous word.

       Some column headings are shorthand for  standardized  character  encod‐
       ings;  “7‐bit”  for ISO 646:1991 IRV (US‐ASCII), “8‐bit” for ISO 8859‐1
       (Latin‐1) and IBM code page 1047, and  “UCS”  for  ISO  10646  (Unicode
       character  set).   Historically, [4mmdoc[24m configured the string definitions
       to fit the capabilities expected of the output device.  Old typesetters
       lacked directional double quotes, producing repeated directional single
       quotes ‘‘like this’’; early versions of [4mmdoc[24m in fact defined  the  ‘Lq’
       and  ‘Rq’  strings  this way.  Nowadays, output drivers take on the re‐
       sponsibility of glyph substitution, as they possess relevant  knowledge
       of their available repertoires.

[1mDiagnostics[0m
       The  debugging  macro ‘.Db’ offered by previous versions of [4mmdoc[24m is un‐
       available in GNU [4mtroff[24m(1) since the latter provides  better  facilities
       to check parameters; additionally, [4mgroff[24m [4mmdoc[24m implements many error and
       warning messages, making the package more robust and more verbose.

       The remaining debugging macro  is  ‘.Rd’,  which  dumps  the  package’s
       global  register  and  string contents to the standard error stream.  A
       normal user will never need it.

[1mOptions[0m
       The following [4mgroff[24m options set registers (with [1m-r[22m) and  strings  (with
       [1m-d[22m) recognized and used by the [4mmdoc[24m macro package.  To ensure rendering
       consistent with output device capabilities and reader preferences,  man
       pages should never manipulate them.

       Setting  string  ‘AD’ configures the adjustment mode for most formatted
       text.  Typical values are ‘b’ for adjustment to both margins  (the  de‐
       fault), or ‘l’ for left alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid ar‐
       gument to [4mgroff[24m’s ‘ad’ request may be used.  See [4mgroff[24m(7) for less‐com‐
       mon choices.

       Setting  register  ‘C’  to 1 numbers output pages consecutively, rather
       than resetting the page number to 1 (or the value of register ‘P’) with
       each new [4mmdoc[24m document.

       By  default,  the package inhibits page breaks, headers, and footers in
       the midst of the document text if it is being displayed with a terminal
       device  such as ‘latin1’ or ‘utf8’, to enable more efficient viewing of
       the page.  This behavior can be changed to format the page  as  if  for
       66‐line  Teletype  output  by setting the continuous rendering register
       ‘cR’ to zero while calling [4mgroff[24m(1).
             [1mgroff -Tlatin1 -rcR=0 -mdoc foo.man > foo.txt[0m
       On HTML devices, it cannot be disabled.

       Section headings (defined with ‘.Sh’) and page titles in  headers  (de‐
       fined with ‘.Dt’) can be presented in full capitals by setting the reg‐
       isters ‘CS’ and ‘CT’, respectively, to 1.   These  transformations  are
       off by default because they discard case distinction information.

       Setting  register  ‘D’  to 1 enables double‐sided page layout, which is
       only distinct when not continuously rendering.  It places the page num‐
       ber  at the bottom right on odd‐numbered (recto) pages, and at the bot‐
       tom left on even‐numbered (verso) pages, swapping places with the argu‐
       ments to ‘.Os’.
             [1mgroff -Tps -rD1 -mdoc foo.man > foo.ps[0m

       The  value  of  the ‘FT’ register determines the footer’s distance from
       the page bottom; this amount is always negative and  should  specify  a
       scaling  unit.   At one half‐inch above this location, the page text is
       broken before writing the footer.  It is ignored if continuous  render‐
       ing is enabled.  The default is -0.5i.

       The ‘HF’ string sets the font used for section and subsection headings;
       the default is ‘B’ (bold style of the default family).  Any valid argu‐
       ment to [4mgroff[24m’s ‘ft’ request may be used.

       Normally,  automatic hyphenation is enabled using a mode appropriate to
       the [4mgroff[24m locale; see section “Localization“ of [4mgroff[24m(7).   It  can  be
       disabled by setting the ‘HY’ register to zero.

       The paragraph and subsection heading indentation amounts can be changed
       by setting the registers ‘IN’ and ‘SN’.
             [1mgroff -Tutf8 -rIN=5n -rSN=2n -mdoc foo.man [22m| [1mless -R[0m
       The default paragraph indentation is 7.2n on typesetters and 7n on ter‐
       minals.   The default subsection heading indentation amount is 3n; sec‐
       tion headings are set with an indentation of zero.

       The line and title lengths can be changed by setting the registers ‘LL’
       and ‘LT’, respectively:
             [1mgroff -Tutf8 -rLL=100n -rLT=100n -mdoc foo.man [22m| [1mless -R[0m
       If not set, both registers default to 78n for terminal devices and 6.5i
       otherwise.

       Setting the ‘P’ register starts enumeration of pages at its value.  The
       default is 1.

       To  change  the  document font size to 11p or 12p, set register ‘S’ ac‐
       cordingly:
             [1mgroff -Tdvi -rS11 -mdoc foo.man > foo.dvi[0m
       Register ‘S’ is ignored when formatting for terminal devices.

       Setting the ‘X’ register to a page number [4mp[24m numbers its  successors  as
       [4mp[24m[1ma[22m, [4mp[24m[1mb[22m, [4mp[24m[1mc[22m, and so forth.  The register tracking the suffixed page let‐
       ter uses format ‘a’ (see the ‘af’ request in [4mgroff[24m(7)).

       ‘.Fn’  needs  to  have  a check to prevent splitting up the line if its

[1mDescription[0m
       The  GNU  implementation  of  the [4mme[24m macro package is part of the [4mgroff[0m
       document formatting system.  The [4mme[24m package of  macro  definitions  for
       the  [4mroff[24m language provides a convenient facility for preparing techni‐
       cal papers in various formats.  This version is based on  the  [4mme[24m  dis‐
       tributed  with  4.4BSD  and can be used with the GNU [4mtroff[24m formatter as
       well as those descended from AT&T [4mtroff[24m.

       Some formatter requests affect page layout unpredictably when  used  in
       conjunction  with this package; however, the following may be used with
       impunity after the first call to a paragraphing macro like  [1mlp  [22mor  [1mpp[22m.
       Some  arguments are optional; see [4mgroff[24m(7) for details, particularly of
       requests whose argument list is designated with an ellipsis.  An aster‐

       Except  on title pages (produced by calling [1mtp[22m), [4mme[24m suppresses the out‐
       put of vertical space at the tops of pages (after  the  output  of  any
       page header); the [1msp [22mrequest will thus not work there.  You can instead
       call [1mbl [22mor enclose the desired spacing request in a diversion, for  in‐
       stance  by  calling  [1m(b [22mand [1m)b[22m.  [4mme[24m also intercepts the [1mll [22mrequest; see
       the “[4mme[24m Reference Manual” for details.

   [1mName space[0m
       Objects in [4mme[24m follow a rigid naming convention.  To avoid conflict, any
       user‐defined register, string, or macro names should be single numerals
       or uppercase letters, or any longer sequence of  letters  and  numerals
       with  at  least one uppercase letter.  (For portability between BSD and
       [4mgroff[24m [4mme[24m, limit names to two characters, and avoid  the  name  [1m[  [22m(left
       square  bracket).)   The  names  employed  by  any preprocessors in use
       should also not be repurposed.

[1mNotes[0m
       Early [4mroff[24m macro packages often limited their names to a single letter,
       which  followed the formatter’s [1mm [22mflag letter, resulting in [4mmm[24m, [4mms[24m, [4mmv[24m,
       [4mmn[24m, and so on.  The “e” in “me” stands for “Eric P. Allman”, who  wrote
       the  macro  package  and  the  original technical papers documenting it
       while an undergraduate at the University of California.

[1mDescription[0m
       The GNU implementation of the [4mmm[24m macro package is  part  of  the  [4mgroff[0m
       document  formatting system.  The [4mmm[24m package is suitable for the compo‐
       sition of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.

       Call an [4mmm[24m macro at the beginning of a document to initialize the pack‐
       age.  A simple [4mmm[24m document might use only [1mP [22mfor paragraphing.  Set num‐
       bered and unnumbered section headings  with  [1mH  [22mand  [1mHU[22m,  respectively.
       Change  the  style  of the typeface with [1mB[22m, [1mI[22m, and [1mR[22m; you can alternate
       styles with [1mBI[22m, [1mBR[22m, [1mIB[22m, [1mIR[22m, [1mRB[22m, and [1mRI[22m.  Several  nestable  list  types
       are available via [1mAL[22m, [1mBL[22m, [1mBVL[22m, [1mDL[22m, [1mML[22m, [1mRL[22m, and [1mVL[22m; each of these begins
       a list, to which [1mLI [22madds an item and [1mLE [22mends the (nested)  list.   Cus‐
       tomized  list arrangements are supported by [1mLB[22m.  [1mDS [22mand [1mDF [22mstart static
       and floating displays, respectively; either is terminated with [1mDE[22m.

       [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m is intended to be compatible with the [4mmm[24m implementation  found
       in  the  AT&T  Documenter’s Workbench (DWB), with the following limita‐
       tions.

       • Omitted features include the logo and company name  strings,  [1m}Z  [22mand
         [1m]S[22m,  respectively; the encoded company site location addresses recog‐
         nized as the third argument to the [1mAU [22mmacro; the [1mPv [22m(“private”  head‐
         ing) register; and the [1mOK [22m(other keywords), and [1mPM [22m(proprietary mark‐
         ings) macros.

       • The [1mCS [22m(output cover sheet) macro is implemented only for  memorandum
         type 4.

       • The  [4mgrap[24m  preprocessor  is  not  explicitly  supported; no [1mG1 [22mand [1mG2[0m
         macros are defined.

       • The registers [1mA[22m, [1mC[22m, [1mE[22m, [1mT[22m, and [1mU[22m, typically  set  from  the  [4mtroff[24m  or
         [4mnroff[24m command lines with DWB [4mmm[24m, are not recognized.

       • When  setting  the registers [1mL [22mor [1mW [22mfrom the command line, use an ex‐
         plicit scaling unit to avoid surprises.

       • DWB [4mmm[24m’s [1mnP [22mmacro indented the second line of a paragraph to align it
         with the start of the text of the first (after the paragraph number);
         [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m’s does not.

       • Cut marks are not supported.

       DWB [4mmm[24m supported only seven levels of heading.  As a compatible  exten‐
       sion,  [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m supports fourteen, introducing new registers [1mH8 [22mthrough
       [1mH14[22m, and affecting the interpretation of the [1mHF [22mand [1mHP [22mstrings.

       Macro, register, and string descriptions in this page  frequently  men‐
       tion each other; most cross references are to macros.  Where a register
       or string is referenced, its type is explicitly identified.  [4mmm[24m’s macro
       names  are usually in full capitals; registers and strings tend to have
       mixed‐case names.

   [1mDocument styles[0m
       [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m offers three different frameworks for  document  organization.
       [1mCOVER[22m/[1mCOVEND  [22mis a flexible means of preparing any document requiring a
       cover page.  [1mLT[22m/[1mLO [22maids preparation of  typical  Anglophone  correspon‐
       dence  (business  letters, for example).  The [1mMT [22mmemorandum type mecha‐
       nism implements a group of formal styles historically used by AT&T Bell
       Laboratories.   Your  document  can  select  at  most  one of these ap‐
       proaches; when used, each disables the others.

   [1mLocalization[0m
       [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m is designed to be easily localized.  For languages other  than
       English,  strings  that  can appear in output are collected in the file
       [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/[24mxx[4m.tmac[24m, where [4mxx[24m is an ISO 639 two‐letter
       language  identifier.  Localization packages should be loaded after [4mmm[24m;
       for example, you might format a Swedish [4mmm[24m document  with  the  command
       “[1mgroff -mm -msv[22m”.

       This  package  can also be localized by site or territory; for example,
       [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mse.tmac[24m illustrates how to adapt the out‐
       put  to  a national standard using its ISO 3166 territory code.  Such a
       package can define a string that causes a macro file  [4m/usr/share/groff/[0m
       [4m1.23.0/tmac/mm/[24mterritory[4m_locale[24m to be loaded at package initialization.
       If this mechanism is not  used,  [4m/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/locale[0m
       is loaded instead.  No diagnostic is produced if these files do not ex‐
       ist.

   [1mRegisters and strings[0m
       Much [4mmm[24m behavior can be configured by registers and strings.  A  regis‐
       ter is assigned with the [1mnr [22mrequest.

              [1m.nr [4m[22mident[24m [[1m±[22m][4mn[24m [[4mi[24m]

       [4mident[24m  is  the name of the register, and [4mn[24m is the value to be assigned.
       [4mn[24m can be prefixed with a plus or minus sign if incrementation or decre‐
       mentation  (respectively)  of the register’s existing value by [4mn[24m is de‐
       sired.  If assignment of a (possibly) negative [4mn[24m is  required,  further
       prefix it with a zero or enclose it in parentheses.  If [4mi[24m is specified,
       the register is automatically modified by [4mi[24m prior to interpolation if a
       plus or minus sign is included in the escape sequence as follows.

              [1m\n[22m[[1m±[22m][1m[[4m[22mident[24m[1m][0m

       [4mi[24m  can  be negative; it combines algebraically with the sign in the in‐
       terpolation escape sequence.

       Strings are defined with the [1mds [22mrequest.

              [1m.ds [4m[22mident[24m [4mcontents[0m

       [4mcontents[24m consumes everything up to  the  end  of  the  line,  including
       trailing  spaces.  It is a good practice to end [4mcontents[24m with a comment
       escape sequence ([1m\"[22m) so that extraneous spaces do  not  intrude  during
       document maintenance.  To include leading spaces in [4mcontents[24m, prefix it
       with a double quote.  Strings are interpolated with the [1m\*  [22mescape  se‐
       quence.

              [1m\*[[4m[22mident[24m[1m][0m

       Register  and  string  name spaces are distinct, but strings and macros
       share a name space.  Defining a string with the  same  name  as  an  [4mmm[0m
       macro  is not supported and may cause incorrect rendering, the emission
       of diagnostic messages, and an error exit status from [4mtroff[24m.

   [1mRegister format[0m
       A register is interpolated using Arabic numerals if no other format has
       been  assigned  to  it.   Assign a format to a register with the [1maf [22mre‐
       quest.

              [1m.af [4m[22mR[24m [4mc[0m

       [4mR[24m is the name of the register, and [4mc[24m is the format.  If [4mc[24m is a sequence
       of  Arabic numerals, their quantity defines a zero‐padded minimum width
       for the interpolated register value.

              [1mForm   Sequence[0m
              1      0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, ...
              001    000, 001, 002, 003, ..., 1000, ...
              i      0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...
              I      0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a      0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
              A      0, A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...

   [1mFonts[0m
       In [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m, the fonts (or rather, font styles) [1mR [22m(roman), [1mI  [22m(italic),
       and  [1mB  [22m(bold) are mounted at font positions [1m1[22m, [1m2[22m, and [1m3[22m, respectively.
       Internally, font positions are used for backward compatibility.  From a
       practical  point  of view, it doesn’t make a big difference—a different
       font family can still be selected by invoking [4mgroff[24m’s  [1mfam  [22mrequest  or
       using  its  [1m-f  [22mcommand‐line option.  On the other hand, if you want to
       replace just, for example, font [1mI  [22mwith  Zapf  Chancery  Medium  italic
       (available  on  [4mgroff[24m’s [1mpdf [22mand [1mps [22moutput devices), you have to use the
       [1mfp [22mrequest, replacing the font at position 2 with “[1m.fp 2  ZCMI[22m”).   Be‐
       cause the cover sheet, memorandum type, and [4mrefer[24m(1) integration macros
       explicitly request fonts named [1mB[22m, [1mI[22m, and [1mR[22m, you will also need to remap
       these font names with the [1mftr [22mrequest, for instance with “[1m.ftr I ZCMI[22m”.

[1mMacros[0m
       An  explicitly  empty  argument  may be specified with a pair of double
       quotes; to call a macro [1mXX [22mwith an empty second argument but  non‐empty
       first and third ones, you could input the following.

              .XX foo "" baz

       Macro names longer than two characters are GNU extensions; some shorter
       names were not part of DWB [4mmm[24m’s published interface but are  documented
       aspects of [4mgroff[24m [4mmm.[0m

       [1m)E [4m[22mlevel[24m [4mtext[0m
              Add heading text [4mtext[24m to the table of contents with [4mlevel[24m, which
              is either 0 or in the range 1 to 7.  See also [1mH[22m.   This  undocu‐
              mented  DWB [4mmm[24m macro is exposed by [4mgroff[24m [4mmm[24m to enable customized
              tables of contents.

       [1m1C [22m[[1m1[22m] Format page text in one column.  The page is broken.  A [1m1  [22margu‐
              ment  suppresses  this  break; its use may cause body text and a
              pending footnote to overprint.  See [1m2C[22m, [1mMC[22m, and [1mNCOL[22m.

       [1m2C     [22mBegin two‐column formatting.  This is a special case of [1mMC[22m.  See
              [1m1C [22mand [1mNCOL[22m.

       [1mAE     [22mAbstract end; stop collecting abstract text.  See [1mAS[22m.

       [1mAF [22m[[4mfirm‐name[24m]
              Specify  firm  associated with the document.  At most one can be
              declared; the firm name is used by memorandum types  and  avail‐
              able  to  cover  sheets.  [1mAF [22mterminates a document title started
              with [1mTL[22m, and can be called without an argument for that purpose.
              See [1mMT [22mand [1mCOVER[22m.

       [1mAL [22m[[4mtype[24m [[4mtext‐indent[24m [[1m1[22m]]]
              Begin an auto‐incrementing numbered list.  Item numbers start at
              one.  The [4mtype[24m argument assigns the register format (see  above)
              of  the list item enumerators.  The default is [1m1[22m.  An explicitly
              empty [4mtype[24m also indicates the default.  A  [4mtext‐indent[24m  argument
              overrides  register  [1mLi[22m.   A third argument suppresses the blank
              line that normally precedes each list item.  Use [1mLI  [22mto  declare
              list items, and [1mLE [22mto end the list.

       [1mAPP [22m[[4mid[24m [[4mtitle[24m]]
              Begin  an  appendix.  If the identifier [4mid[24m is omitted, it is in‐
              cremented (or initialized, if necessary).  The  register  format
              used  for  [4mid[24m is “A”.  The page is broken.  The register [1mAph [22mde‐
              termines whether an appendix heading is  then  formatted.   This
              heading  uses  the string [1mApp [22mfollowed by [4mid[24m.  Appendices appear
              in any table of contents (see [1mTC[22m).  The string [1mApptxt [22mis set  to
              [4mtitle[24m if the latter is present, and made empty otherwise.

       [1mAPPSK [4m[22mid[24m [4mn[24m [[4mtitle[24m]
              As  [1mAPP[22m,  but increment the page number by [4mn[24m.  Use this macro to
              “skip pages” when diagrams or other materials not  formatted  by
              [4mtroff[24m are included in appendices.

       [1mAS [22m[[4mplacement[24m [[4mindentation[24m]]

              location of the abstract on the cover sheet of a memorandum (see
              [1mMT[22m).  [1mCOVER[22m, by contrast, ignores [4mplacement[24m by default, but  can
              be customized to interpret it.

              0           The  abstract  appears  on page 1 and cover sheet if

                          [1m4[22m”); otherwise, it appears on page 1 without a cover
                          sheet.

              [1mQrf [22mmay be changed to support other languages.  Strings [1mQrfh [22mand
              [1mQrfp  [22mare  set  by [1mGETR [22mand contain the page and heading number,
              respectively.

       [1mGETST [4m[22mrefname[24m [[4mvarname[24m]
              Include the string saved with  the  second  argument  to  [1m.SETR[22m.
              This  is  a  dummy  string in pass 1.  If [4mvarname[24m is used, [1mGETST[0m
              sets it to the saved string.  See [1mINITR[22m.

       [1mH [4m[22mlevel[24m [[4mtitle[24m [[4msuffix[24m]]
              Set a numbered section heading at [4mlevel[24m.  [4mmm[24m  produces  numbered
              [4mheading[24m  [4mmarks[24m  of the form [4ma[24m.[4mb[24m.[4mc[24m..., with up to fourteen levels
              of nesting.  Each level’s number  increases  automatically  with
              each  [1mH  [22mcall and is reset to zero when a more significant [4mlevel[0m
              is specified.  “[1m1[22m” is the most significant or coarsest  division
              of  the  document.  Text after an [1mH [22mcall is formatted as a para‐
              graph; calling [1mP [22mis unnecessary.

              [4mtitle[24m specifies an optional title; it must be  double‐quoted  if
              it  contains  spaces.  [4mmm[24m appends [4msuffix[24m to [4mtitle[24m in the body of
              the document, but omits it from any table of contents (see  [1mTC[22m).
              This  facility  can be used to annotate the heading title with a
              footnote.  [4msuffix[24m should not interpolate the [1mF [22mstring; specify a
              footnote mark explicitly.  See [1mFS[22m.

              Heading  behavior is highly configurable.  Several registers set
              a [4mthreshold,[24m where heading levels  at  or  below  the  threshold
              value  are  handled in one way, and those above it another.  For
              example, a heading level within the threshold of register [1mCl  [22mis
              included in the table of contents (see [1mTC[22m).

              [4mHeading[24m  [4mlayout.[24m  Register [1mEj [22msets a threshold for page breaking
              (ejection) prior to a heading.  If not preceded by a page break,
              a  heading level below the threshold in register [1mHps [22mis preceded
              by the amount of vertical space in register  [1mHps1[22m,  and  by  the
              amount  in [1mHps2 [22motherwise.  The [1mHb [22mregister sets a threshold be‐
              low which a break occurs after the heading, and register [1mHs [22msets
              a threshold below which vertical space follows it.  If the head‐
              ing level is not less than both of these, a  [4mrun‐in[24m  [4mheading[24m  is
              produced;  paragraph text follows on the same output line.  Oth‐
              erwise, register [1mHi [22mconfigures the  indentation  of  text  after
              headings.   Threshold register [1mHc [22menables the centering of head‐
              ings; a heading level below both of the [1mHb [22mand [1mHc [22mthresholds  is
              centered.

              [4mHeading[24m  [4mtypeface[24m  [4mand[24m [4msize.[24m  The fonts used for heading numbers
              and titles at each level are configured by the [1mHF  [22mstring.   The
              string  [1mHP  [22mlikewise  assigns a type size to each heading level.
              The vertical spacing used by headings may be controlled  by  the
              user‐definable macros [1mHX [22mand/or [1mHZ[22m.

              [4mHeading[24m  [4mnumber[24m  [4mformat.[24m   Registers  named [1mH1 [22mthrough [1mH14 [22mstore
              counters for each heading level.  Their values are printed using
              Arabic  numerals  by  default;  see  [1mHM[22m.  The heading levels are
              catenated with dots for formatting; to typeset only the deepest,
              set  the  [1mHt  [22mregister.  Heading numbers are not suffixed with a
              trailing dot except when only the first level is output; to omit
              a dot in this case as well, clear the [1mH1dot [22mregister.

              [4mCustomizing[24m  [4mheading[24m  [4mbehavior.[24m   [4mmm[24m calls [4mhook[24m macros to enable
              further customization of headings.  (DWB [4mmm[24m  called  these  “ex‐
              its”.)   They can be used to change the heading’s [4mmark[24m (the num‐
              bered portion before any heading title), its  vertical  spacing,
              and  its vertical space requirements (for instance, to require a
              minimum quantity  of  subsequent  output  lines).   Define  hook
              macros in expectation of the following parameters.  The argument
              [4mdeclared‐level[24m is the [4mlevel[24m argument to [1mH[22m, or [1m0  [22mfor  unnumbered
              headings  (see  [1mHU[22m).  [4mactual‐level[24m is the same as [4mdeclared‐level[0m
              for numbered headings, and the value of register [1mHu  [22mfor  unnum‐
              bered headings.  [4mtitle[24m is the corresponding argument to [1mH [22mor [1mHU[22m.

              [1mHX [4m[22mdeclared‐level[24m [4mactual‐level[24m [4mtitle[0m

                     may alter [1m}0[22m, [1m}2[22m, and [1m;3[22m.

                     [1m}0 [22m(string)
                            contains the heading mark plus two spaces  if  [4mde‐[0m

                            encodes a position for the text after the heading.
                            0 means that the heading is to be run in, 1  means
                            that  a  break  is  to  occur before the text, and
                            2 means that vertical space is to separate heading
                            and text.

                     [1m}2 [22m(string)
                            is the suffix that separates a run‐in heading from
                            the text.  It contains two spaces if  register  [1m;0[0m
                            is 0, and otherwise is empty.

                     [1m;3 [22m(register)
                            contains the vertical space required for the head‐
                            ing to be typeset.  If that amount is  not  avail‐
                            able,  the  page  is  broken prior to the heading.
                            The default is [1m2v[22m.

              register  format (see above) to the corresponding heading level.
              The default is [1m1 [22mfor all levels.  An explicitly  empty  argument
              also indicates the default.

              they suit the desired purpose.

              The nesting level of lists is tracked by [4mmm;[24m the outermost level
              is  0.   The  text of each list item is indented by [4mtext‐indent;[0m
              the default is taken from the [1mLi [22mregister (in ens).  Each item’s
              mark is indented by [4mmark‐indent;[24m the default is [1m0n[22m.  The mark is
              normally left‐aligned.  If [4mpad[24m is greater than zero, [4mmark‐indent[0m
              is  overridden such that [4mpad[24m ens of space follow the mark.  [4mtype[0m

              If [4mtype[24m is 0 and [4mmark[24m is unspecified, the items are set  with  a
              hanging  indent.   Otherwise,  [4mmark[24m  is  interpreted as a string
              defining the mark.  If [4mtype[24m is greater than zero, items are  au‐
              tomatically  numbered; [4mmark[24m is interpreted as a register format.
              The default [4mtype[24m is [1m0[22m.

              pairs.  The reference counter is reset unless the first argument
              is  [1m1[22m.   Normally, page breaks occur before and after the refer‐
              ences are output; the register [1mRpe [22mconfigures this behavior, and
              a  second  argument  overrides its value.  [1mTC [22mcalls [1mRP [22mautomati‐

              References are list items, and  thus  are  vertically  separated
              (see  [1mLB[22m).   Setting  register  [1mLs [22mto [1m0 [22msuppresses this spacing.

              Captioned  tables  are listed in a table of contents (see [1mTC[22m) if
              the Boolean register [1mLt [22mis true.  Such a list uses the string [1mLt[0m

              Output  table  of  contents.   This  macro  is normally the last
              called in the document.  It flushes any pending displays and, if
              any references are pending (see [1mRS[22m), calls [1mRP[22m.  It then begins a
              new page with the contents caption, stored in the string  [1mLicon[22m,
              centered  at  the  top.   The entries follow after three vees of
              space.  Each entry is a saved section (number and) heading title
              (see  the  [1mCl  [22mregister), along with its associated page number.
              By default, an entry is indented by an amount  corresponding  to
              its  heading level and the maximum heading length encountered at
              that heading level; if defined, the string  [1mCi  [22moverrides  these
              indentations.   Entries  at  heading  levels up to and including
              [4mslevel[24m are preceded by [4mspacing[24m vees of space.  Entries at  head‐
              ing  levels  up to and including [4mtlevel[24m are followed by a leader
              and a right‐aligned page number.  If the Boolean‐valued [4mtab[24m  ar‐
              gument is true, the leader is replaced with horizontal motion in
              the same amount.  For entries above heading  level  [4mtlevel[24m,  the
              page  number  follows the heading text after a word space.  Each
              argument [4mh1[24m...[4mh5[24m appears in order on  its  own  line,  centered,
              above  the  contents  caption.  Page numbering restarts at 1, in
              register format “i”.  If the [1mOc [22mregister is true,  numbering  of
              these pages is suppressed.

              If  [1mTC [22mis called with at most four arguments, it calls the user‐
              defined macro [1mTX [22m(if defined) prior to formatting  the  contents
              caption,  and [1mTY [22m(if defined) [4minstead[24m of formatting the contents
              caption.

              Analogous handling of lists of figures, tables,  equations,  and
              exhibits  is achieved by defining [1mTX[4m[22mxx[24m and [1mTY[4m[22mxx[24m macros, where [4mxx[0m
              is “FG”, “TB”, “EC”,  or  “EX”,  respectively.   Similarly,  the
              strings  [1mLifg[22m, [1mLitb[22m, [1mLiex[22m, and [1mLiec [22mdetermine captions for their

       The [1mLT [22mletter macros call further macros depending on the letter  type,
       with which they are suffixed.  It is therefore possible to define addi‐
       tional letter types, either in the territory‐specific macro file, or as
       local  additions.   [1mLT [22msets the registers [1mPt [22mand [1mPi [22mto 0 and 5, respec‐

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mmom[24m is a macro set for [4mgroff[24m, designed primarily to  prepare  documents
       for  PDF and PostScript output.  [4mmom[24m provides macros in two categories:
       typesetting and document processing.   The  former  provide  access  to
       [4mgroff[24m’s  typesetting  capabilities  in  ways that are simpler to master
       than [4mgroff[24m’s requests and escape sequences.  The latter provide  highly
       customizable  markup tags that allow the user to design and output pro‐
       fessional‐looking documents with a minimum of typesetting intervention.

       Files processed with [4mpdfmom[24m(1) produce PDF  documents.   The  documents
       include a PDF outline that appears in the navigation pane panel of doc‐
       ument viewers, and may contain clickable internal and external links.

       Normally.  [4mgroff[24m’s native PDF driver, [4mgropdf[24m(1), is  used  to  generate
       the output.  When [4mpdfmom[24m is given the “[1m-T ps[22m” option, it still produces
       PDF, but processing is delegated to [4mpdfroff[24m, which uses  [4mgroff[24m’s  Post‐
       Script driver, [4mgrops[24m(1).  Not all PDF features are available when [1m-T ps[0m
       is given; its primary use is to allow processing of files with embedded
       PostScript images.

       Files processed with [1mgroff -mom [22m(or [1m-m mom[22m) format for the device spec‐
       ified with the [1m-T [22moption.  (In this installation,  [1mps  [22mis  the  default
       output device.)

       [4mmom[24m comes with her own comprehensive documentation in HTML.  A PDF man‐
       ual, “Producing PDFs with [4mgroff[24m and [4mmom[24m”, discusses preparation of  PDF
       documents with [4mmom[24m in detail.

              lines to function properly.  Please see [4mIMPORTANT[24m, below.

              String  tabs  need to be marked off with inline escape sequences
              before being set up with the [1m.ST [22mmacro.  Any input line may con‐
              tain  string  tab  markers.   [4m<number>[24m, above, means the numeric
              identifier of the tab.

              The following shows a sample input line with string tab markers.
                     [1m\*[ST1][22mDe minimus[1m\*[ST1X][22mnon curat[1m\*[ST2][22mlex[1m\*[ST2X][22m.

              String [4mtab[24m [4m1[24m begins at the start of the line and ends after  the
              word [4mtime[24m.  String [4mtab[24m [4m2[24m starts at [4mgood[24m and ends after [4mmen[24m.  [4mIn‐[0m

              izontal  movements,  including  padding)  are taken into account
              when [4mmom[24m determines the [4mposition[24m and [4mlength[24m of [4mstring[24m [4mtabs[24m.

              Up to nineteen string tabs may be marked (not necessarily all on
              the  same  line, of course), and they must be numbered between 1
              and 19.

              Once string tabs have been marked in input lines, they  have  to
              be [4mset[24m with [1m.ST[22m, after which they may be called, by number, with
              [1m.TAB[22m.

              Note: Lines with string tabs marked off in them are normal input
              lines,  i.e. they get printed, just like any input line.  If you
              want to set up string tabs without the line  printing,  use  the
              [1m.SILENT [22mmacro.

              [4mIMPORTANT:[24m  Owing  to  the  way  [4mgroff[24m processes input lines and
              turns them into output lines, it is  not  possible  for  [4mmom[24m  to
              [4mguess[24m the correct starting position of string tabs marked off in
              lines that are centered or set flush right.

              Equally, she cannot guess the starting position  if  a  line  is
              fully justified and broken with [1m.SPREAD[22m.

              In  other  words,  in order to use string tabs, [1mLEFT [22mmust be ac‐

              [1m.B_MARGIN  [22msets a nominal position at the bottom of the page be‐
              yond which you don’t want your type to go.  When the bottom mar‐
              gin  is  reached,  [4mmom[24m  starts a new page.  [1m.B_MARGIN requires a[0m
              [1munit of measure.  [22mDecimal fractions are allowed.  To set a nomi‐
              nal bottom margin of 3/4 inch, enter
                     [1m.B_MARGIN .75i[0m

              Obviously,  if you haven’t spaced the type on your pages so that
              the last lines fall perfectly at the bottom margin,  the  margin
              will  vary from page to page.  Usually, but not always, the last
              line of type that fits on a page before the bottom margin causes
              mom to start a new page.

              Occasionally,  owing  to  a  peculiarity in [4mgroff[24m, an extra line
              will fall below the nominal bottom margin.  If you’re using  the
              document processing macros, this is unlikely to happen; the doc‐
              ument processing macros are very hard‐nosed about aligning  bot‐
              tom margins.

              Note: The meaning of [1m.B_MARGIN [22mis slightly different when you’re
              using the document processing macros.

       [1m.FAMILY [4m[22m<family>[0m
              Type Family, alias of [1m.FAM[0m

              [1m.FAMILY  [22mtakes  one  argument:  the name of the [4mfamily[24m you want.
              [4mGroff[24m comes with a small set of basic families, each  identified
              by a 1‐, 2‐ or 3‐letter mnemonic.  The standard families are:
                     [1mA   = Avant Garde[0m
                     [1mBM  = Bookman[0m
                     [1mH   = Helvetica[0m
                     [1mHN  = Helvetica Narrow[0m
                     [1mN   = New Century Schoolbook[0m
                     [1mP   = Palatino[0m
                     [1mT   = Times Roman[0m
                     [1mZCM = Zapf Chancery[0m

              The  argument  you  pass  to  [1m.FAMILY [22mis the identifier at left,
              above.  For example, if you want [1mHelvetica[22m, enter
                     [1m.FAMILY H[0m

              Note: The font macro ([1m.FT[22m) lets you specify both the type [4mfamily[0m
              and  the  desired  font with a single macro.  While this saves a
              few keystrokes, I recommend using [1m.FAMILY for  [4m[22mfamily[24m,  and  [1m.FT[0m
              [1mfor [4m[22mfont[24m, except where doing so is genuinely inconvenient.  [1mZCM[22m,
              for example, only exists in one style: [1mItalic [22m([1mI[22m).

              Therefore,
                     [1m.FT ZCMI[0m
              makes more sense than setting the [4mfamily[24m to  [1mZCM[22m,  then  setting
              the [4mfont[24m to [4mI[24m.

              Additional  note:  If  you  are running a [4mgroff[24m version prior to
              1.19.2, you must follow all [1m.FAMILY [22mrequests with a [1m.FT [22mrequest,
              otherwise  [4mmom[24m  will  set all type up to the next [1m.FT [22mrequest in
              the fallback font.

              If you are running [4mgroff[24m 1.19.2 or later, when  you  invoke  the
              [1m.FAMILY [22mmacro, [4mmom[24m [4mremembers[24m the font style [1m([22mRoman[1m, Italic[22m, etc)
              currently in use (if the font style exists in  the  new  [4mfamily[24m)
              and  will continue to use the same font style in the new family.
              For example:
                     [1m.FAMILY BM [4m[22m\"[24m [4mBookman[24m [4mfamily[0m
                     [1m.FT I [4m[22m\"[24m [4mMedium[24m [4mItalic[0m
                     [4m<some[24m [4mtext>[24m [4m\"[24m [4mBookman[24m [4mMedium[24m [4mItalic[0m

              However, if the font style does not exist in the new family, [4mmom[0m
              will  set  all subsequent type in the fallback font (by default,
              [1mCourier Medium Roman[22m) until she encounters a [1m.FT [22mrequest  that’s
              valid for the [4mfamily[24m.

              For  example,  assuming you don’t have the font [1mMedium Condensed[0m
              [1mRoman [22m([4mmom[24m extension [4mCD[24m) in the [4mHelvetica[24m [4mfamily[24m:

              In the above example, you must follow [1m.FAMILY H [22mwith a  [1m.FT  [22mre‐
              quest that’s valid for [1mHelvetica[22m.

              Please  see  the Appendices, [4mAdding[24m [4mfonts[24m [4mto[24m [4mgroff[24m, for informa‐
              tion on adding fonts and families to [4mgroff[24m,[4mas[24mwell[4mas[24mto see a list
              of  the  extensions  [4mmom[24m  provides  to [4mgroff[24m’s basic [1mR[22m, [1mI[22m, [1mB[22m, [1mBI[0m
              styles.

              Suggestion: When adding [4mfamilies[24m [4mto[24m [4mgroff[24m, I recommend following
              the established standard for the naming families and fonts.  For
              example, if you add the [1mGaramond [22mfamily, name the font files
                     [1mGARAMONDR[0m
                     [1mGARAMONDI[0m

                     [1mGARAMONDBI[0m
              [1mGARAMOND then becomes a valid [4m[22mfamily[24m [4mname[24m you can pass to [1m.FAMI‐[0m
              [1mLY[22m.   (You could, of course, shorten [1mGARAMOND [22mto just [1mG[22m, or [1mGD[22m.)
              [1mR[22m, [1mI[22m, [1mB[22m, and [1mBI [22mafter [1mGARAMOND [22mare the [4mroman[24m, [4mitalic[24m,  [4mbold[24m  and

              Set font

              By default, [4mgroff[24m permits [1m.FT [22mto take one of four possible argu‐
              ments specifying the desired font:
                     [1mR = (Medium) Roman[0m
                     [1mI = (Medium) Italic[0m
                     [1mB = Bold (Roman)[0m
                     [1mBI = Bold Italic[0m

              For example, if your [4mfamily[24m is [1mHelvetica[22m, entering
                     [1m.FT B[0m
              will give you the [4mHelvetica[24m [4mbold[24m  [4mfont[24m.   If  your  [4mfamily[24m  were
              [1mPalatino[22m, you’d get the [4mPalatino[24m [4mbold[24m [4mfont[24m.

              [1mMom  [22mconsiderably extends the range of arguments you can pass to
              [1m.FT[22m, making it more convenient to add and access fonts  of  dif‐
              fering weights and shapes within the same family.

              Have  a  look  here for a list of the weight/style arguments [4mmom[0m
              allows.  Be aware, though, that you must have  the  fonts,  cor‐
              rectly installed and named, in order to use the arguments.  (See
              [4mAdding[24m [4mfonts[24m [4mto[24m [4mgroff[24m for instructions and information.)  Please

              How [4mmom[24m reacts to an invalid argument to [1m.FT  [22mdepends  on  which
              version  of [4mgroff[24m you’re using.  If your [4mgroff[24m version is 1.19.2
              or later, [4mmom[24m will issue a warning and, depending on how  you’ve
              set  up  the fallback font, either continue processing using the
              fallback font, or abort (allowing you to correct  the  problem).
              In  earlier versions, [4mmom[24m will silently continue processing, us‐
              ing either the fallback font or the font that was in effect pri‐
              or to the invalid [1m.FT [22mcall.

              [1m.FT  [22mwill  also  accept,  as an argument, a full [4mfamily[24m and [4mfont[0m
              [4mname[24m.

              For example,
                     [1m.FT HB[0m
              will set subsequent type in [4mHelvetica[24m [4mBold[24m.

              However, I strongly recommend keeping [4mfamily[24m and  [4mfont[24m  separate
              except where doing so is genuinely inconvenient.

              A hanging indent looks like this:

                       will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a

              Generally speaking, you should invoke [1m.HI [22mimmediately  prior  to

                     1.\0The most important point to be considered is whether
                     the answer to the meaning of Life, the Universe, and
                     Everything really is 42.  We have no one's word on the
                     subject except Mr. Adams's.

                     2.\0If the answer to the meaning of Life, the Universe,
                     and Everything is indeed 42, what impact does this have on
                     the politics of representation?  42 is, after all not a
                     prime number.  Are we to infer that prime numbers don't
                     deserve equal rights and equal access in the universe?
                     .HI
                     3.\0If 42 is deemed non‐exclusionary, how do we present
                     it as the answer and, at the same time, forestall debate
                     on its exclusionary implications?

              First, we invoke a left indent with a measure equal to the width
              of 2 figures spaces plus a period (using the \w inline  escape).
              At  this  point, the left indent is active; text afterward would
              normally be indented.  However, we invoke a  hanging  indent  of
              exactly  the  same  width, which hangs the first line (and first
              line only!) to the left of the indent by the same  distance  (in
              this case, that means “out to the left margin”).  Because we be‐
              gin the first line with a number, a period, and a figure  space,
              the  actual text ([4mThe[24m [4mmost[24m [4mimportant[24m [4mpoint...[24m) starts at exactly
              the same spot as the indented lines that follow.

              Notice that subsequent invocations of [1m.HI [22mdon’t require  a  [4mmea‐[0m
              [4msure[24m to be given.

              [1m.IB [22mallows you to set or invoke a left and a right indent at the
              same time.

              At its first invocation, you must supply a measure for both  in‐
              dents;  at subsequent invocations when you wish to supply a mea‐
              sure, both must be given again.  As with [1m.IL [22mand [1m.IR[22m,  the  mea‐
              sures  are  added  to the values previously passed to the macro.
              Hence, if you wish to change just one of the  values,  you  must
              give an argument of zero to the other.

              [1m.IB[22m.  You’ll save yourself a lot of grief.

              A  [4mminus[24m [4msign[24m may be prepended to the arguments to subtract from

              able.

              Without an argument, the macros to quit indents  merely  restore
              your  original  margins and line length.  The measures stored in
              the indent macros themselves are saved  so  you  can  call  them
              again without having to supply a measure.

              If  you  pass these macros the optional argument [1mCLEAR[22m, they not
              only restore your original left margin and line length, but also
              clear any values associated with a particular indent style.  The
              next time you need an indent of the same style, you have to sup‐
              ply a measure again.

              L_MARGIN establishes the distance from  the  left  edge  of  the

              Left  indents and tabs are calculated from the value you pass to
              [1m.L_MARGIN[22m, hence it’s always a good idea  to  invoke  it  before
              starting  any  serious  typesetting.   A  unit of measure is re‐
              quired.  Decimal fractions are allowed.  Therefore, to  set  the
              left margin at 3 picas (1/2 inch), you’d enter either
                     [1m.L_MARGIN 3P[0m

              If you pass the [4m<distance>[24m argument to [1m.MCX[22m, it advances [4m1[24m [4mline‐[0m
              [4mspace[24m below the longest column (see  above)  [4mPLUS[24m  the  distance
              specified by the argument.  The argument requires a unit of mea‐
              sure; therefore, to advance an extra 6 points below  where  [1m.MCX[0m
              would normally place you, you’d enter
                     [1m.MCX 6p[0m

              [4mNote:[24m  If you wish to advance a precise distance below the base‐
              line of the longest column, use [1m.MCX [22mwith an argument of [1m0  [22m(ze‐

                     [1m.ALD 24p[0m

              the longest column.

       [1m.NEWPAGE[0m

              Whenever  you  want to start a new page, use [1m.NEWPAGE[22m, by itself
              with no argument.  [1mMom [22mwill finish  up  processing  the  current
              page  and  move  you to the top of a new one (subject to the top
              margin set with [1m.T_MARGIN[22m).

              All arguments require a unit of measure

              [4mIMPORTANT:[24m If you’re using the document processing macros, [1m.PAGE[0m
              must come after [1m.START[22m.  Otherwise, it should go at the top of a
              document, prior to any text.  And remember,  when  you’re  using
              the  document  processing  macros,  top margin and bottom margin
              mean something slightly different than when  you’re  using  just
              the  typesetting  macros (see Top and bottom margins in document
              processing).

              [1m.PAGE [22mlets you establish paper dimensions and page margins  with
              a  single macro.  The only required argument is page width.  The
              rest are optional, but they must appear in order and  you  can’t
              skip  over  any.   [4m<lm>[24m,  [4m<rm>[24m, [4m<tm>[24m and [4m<bm>[24m refer to the left,
              right, top and bottom margins respectively.

              Assuming your page dimensions are 11 inches by  17  inches,  and
              that’s all you want to set, enter
                     [1m.PAGE 11i 17i[0m
              If you want to set the left margin as well, say, at 1 inch, [1mPAGE[0m
              would look like this:
                     [1m.PAGE 11i 17i 1i[0m

              Now suppose you also want to set the top margin, say,  at  1–1/2
              inches.   [4m<tm>[24m  comes  after [4m<rm>[24m in the optional arguments, but
              you can’t skip over any arguments, therefore to set the top mar‐
              gin,  you  must also give a right margin.  The [1m.PAGE [22mmacro would
              look like this:
                     .PAGE 11i 17i 1i 1i 1.5i
                                      |   |
                     required right---+   +---top margin
                             margin

              Clearly, [1m.PAGE [22mis best used when you want a  convenient  way  to
              tell  [4mmom[24m  just  the dimensions of your printer sheet (width and
              length), or when you want to tell her everything about the  page
              (dimensions and all the margins), for example
                     [1m.PAGE 8.5i 11i 45p 45p 45p 45p[0m
              This  sets  up  an  8½ by 11 inch page with margins of 45 points
              (5/8‐inch) all around.

              Additionally, if you invoke [1m.PAGE [22mwith a  top  margin  argument,
              any macros you invoke after [1m.PAGE [22mwill almost certainly move the
              baseline of the first line of text down by  one  linespace.   To
              compensate, do
                     [1m.RLD 1v[0m
              immediately before entering any text, or, if it’s feasible, make
              [1m.PAGE [22mthe last macro you invoke prior to entering text.

              one of: [1mLETTER[22m, [1mLEGAL[22m, [1mSTATEMENT[22m, [1mTABLOID[22m, [1mLEDGER[22m, [1mFOLIO[22m,  [1mQUAR‐[0m

              Point size of type, does not require a [4munit[24m [4mof[24m [4mmeasure[24m.

              [1m.PT_SIZE  [22m([4mPoint[24m  [4mSize[24m)  takes one argument: the [4msize[24m [4mof[24m [4mtype[24m in
              [4mpoints[24m.  Unlike most other macros that  establish  the  [4msize[24m  or
              [4mmeasure[24m  of something, [1m.PT_SIZE [22mdoes not require that you supply
              a [4munit[24m [4mof[24m [4mmeasure[24m since it’s a near  universal  convention  that
              [4mtype[24m  [4msize[24m is measured in [4mpoints[24m.  Therefore, to change the [4mtype[0m
              [4msize[24m to, say, [4m11[24m [4mpoints[24m, enter
                     [1m.PT_SIZE 11[0m
              [4mPoint[24m [4msizes[24m may be [4mfractional[24m (e.g., [4m10.25[24m or [4m12.5[24m).

              You can prepend a [4mplus[24m or  a  [4mminus[24m  [4msign[24m  to  the  argument  to
              [1m.PT_SIZE[22m, in which case the [4mpoint[24m [4msize[24m will be changed by [4m+[24m or [4m-[0m
              the original value.  For example, if the [4mpoint[24m [4msize[24m is  [4m12[24m,  and
              you want [4m14[24m, you can do
                     [1m.PT_SIZE +2[0m
              then later reset it to [4m12[24m with
                     [1m.PT_SIZE -2[0m
              The [4msize[24m [4mof[24m [4mtype[24m can also be changed inline.

              [4mNote:[24m  It  is  unfortunate that the [1mpic [22mpreprocessor has already
              taken the name, PS, and thus [4mmom[24m’s macro for setting [4mpoint[24m [4msizes[0m
              can’t  use it.  However, if you aren’t using [1mpic[22m, you might want
              to alias [1m.PT_SIZE [22mas [1m.PS[22m, since there’d be no conflict.  For ex‐
              ample
                     [1m.ALIAS PS PT_SIZE[0m
              would allow you to set [4mpoint[24m [4msizes[24m with [1m.PS[22m.

       [1m.R_MARGIN [4m[22m<right[24m [4mmargin>[0m
              Right Margin

              Requires a unit of measure.

              IMPORTANT:   [1m.R_MARGIN[22m,   if   used,  must  come  after  [1m.PAPER[22m,
              [1m.PAGEWIDTH[22m, [1m.L_MARGIN[22m, and/or [1m.PAGE [22m(if  a  right  margin  isn’t
              given  to  PAGE).   The reason is that [1m.R_MARGIN [22mcalculates line
              length from the overall page dimensions and the left margin.

              Obviously, it can’t make the calculation if it doesn’t know  the
              page width and the left margin.

              [1m.R_MARGIN  [22mestablishes  the amount of space you want between the
              end of typeset lines and the right  hand  edge  of  the  printer
              sheet.   In other words, it sets the line length.  [1m.R_MARGIN [22mre‐
              quires a unit of measure.  Decimal fractions are allowed.

              The line length macro (LL) can be used in  place  of  [1m.R_MARGIN[22m.
              In  either case, the last one invoked sets the line length.  The
              choice of which to use is up to you.  In some instances, you may
              find  it  easier to think of a section of type as having a right
              margin.  In others, giving a line length may make more sense.

              For example, if you’re setting a page of type  you  know  should
              have  6‐pica  margins  left and right, it makes sense to enter a
              left and right margin, like this:
                     [1m.L_MARGIN 6P[0m
                     [1m.R_MARGIN 6P[0m

              That way, you don’t have to worry  about  calculating  the  line
              length.   On  the  other hand, if you know the line length for a
              patch of type should be 17 picas and 3 points, entering the line
              length with LL is much easier than calculating the right margin,
              e.g.,
                     [1m.LL 17P+3p[0m

              If you use the macros [1m.PAGE[22m, [1m.PAGEWIDTH [22mor [1mPAPER [22mwithout  invok‐
              ing  [1m.R_MARGIN  [22mafterward, [4mmom[24m automatically sets [1m.R_MARGIN [22mto [4m1[0m
              [4minch[24m.  If you set a line length after these macros  (with  [1m.LL[22m),
              the  line length calculated by [1m.R_MARGIN [22mis, of course, overrid‐
              den.

              Note: [1m.R_MARGIN [22mbehaves in a special way when you’re  using  the
              document processing macros.

              After [4mtabs[24m have been defined (either with [1m.TAB_SET [22mor [1m.ST[22m), [1m.TAB[0m
              moves to whatever [4mtab[24m [4mnumber[24m you pass it as an argument.

              For example,
                     [1m.TAB 3[0m
              moves you to [4mtab[24m [4m3[24m.

              Note: [1m.TAB [22mbreaks the line preceding it  and  advances  1  line‐
              space.  Hence,
                     [1m.TAB 1[0m
                     [1mA line of text in tab 1.[0m

              If  you  want the tabs to line up, use [1m.TN [22m(“Tab Next”) or, more
              conveniently, the inline escape sequence [1m\*[TB+][22m:
                     [1m.TAB [22m1
                     A line of text in tab 1.\*[TB+]
                     A line of text in tab 2.
              which produces
                     [1mA line of text in tab 1.   A line of text in tab 2.[0m

              If the text in your tabs runs to several lines, and you want the

              Temporary left indent — the optional argument requires a [4munit[24m [4mof[0m
              [4mmeasure[0m

              A temporary indent is one that applies only to the first line of
              text that comes after it.  Its chief use is indenting the  first
              line  of paragraphs.  ([1mMom’s .PP [22mmacro, for example, uses a [4mtem‐[0m
              [4mporary[24m [4mindent[24m.)

              The first time you invoke [1m.TI[22m, you must give it a  measure.   If
              you want to [4mindent[24m the first line of a paragraph by, say, 2 ems,
              do
                     [1m.TI 2m[0m

              Subsequent invocations of [1m.TI [22mdo not require  you  to  supply  a
              measure; [4mmom[24m keeps track of the last measure you gave it.

              Because [4mtemporary[24m [4mindents[24m are temporary, there’s no need to turn
              them off.

              [4mIMPORTANT:[24m Unlike [1m.IL[22m, [1m.IR [22mand [1mIB[22m, measures given to [1m.TI [22mare NOT
              additive.   In the following example, the second [1m".TI 2P" [22mis ex‐

              without  advancing on the page.  See the [4mNOTE[24m in the description
              of the [1m.TAB [22mmacro for an example of how [1mTN [22mworks.

              In [4mtabs[24m that aren’t given the [1mQUAD [22margument when they’re set  up
              with  [1m.TAB_SET  [22mor [1mST[22m, you must terminate the line preceding [1m.TN[0m
              with the [1m\c [22minline escape sequence.  Conversely, if you did give
              a [1mQUAD [22margument to [1m.TAB_SET [22mor [1mST[22m, the [1m\c must not be used.[0m

              If you find remembering whether to put in the [1m\c [22mbothersome, you
              may prefer to use the inline escape alternative to [1m.TN[22m, [1m\*[TB+][22m,
              which works consistently regardless of the fill mode.

              [4mNote:[24m You must put text in the input line immediately after [1m.TN[22m.
              Stacking of [1m.TN[22m’s is not allowed.  In other words, you cannot do
                     .TAB 1
                     Some text\c
                     .TN

                     Yet more text
              The above example, assuming [4mtabs[24m numbered from [4m1[24m to [4m4[24m, should be
              entered
                     .TAB 1

                     Yet more text
              \& is a zero‐width, non‐printing character that [4mgroff[24m recognizes
              as valid input, hence meets the requirement for input text  fol‐
              lowing [1m.TN[22m.

              Top margin

              Requires a unit of measure

              [1m.T_MARGIN  [22mestablishes  the distance from the top of the printer
              sheet at which you want your type to start.  It requires a  unit
              of  measure,  and  decimal  fractions are allowed.  To set a top
              margin of 2½ centimetres, you’d enter
                     [1m.T_MARGIN 2.5c[0m
              [1m.T_MARGIN [22mcalculates the vertical position of the first line  of
              type  on a page by treating the top edge of the printer sheet as
              a baseline.  Therefore,
                     [1m.T_MARGIN 1.5i[0m
              puts the baseline of the first line of type  1½  inches  beneath
              the top of the page.

              Note:  [1m.T_MARGIN  [22mmeans something slightly different when you’re
              using the document processing macros.  See Top and  bottom  mar‐
              gins in document processing for an explanation.

              IMPORTANT:  [1m.T_MARGIN  [22mdoes  two  things: it establishes the top
              margin for pages that come after it and it moves to  that  posi‐
              tion  on  the current page.  Therefore, [1m.T_MARGIN [22mshould only be
              used at the top of a file (prior to entering text) or after NEW‐
              PAGE, like this:
                     [1m.NEWPAGE[0m
                     [1m.T_MARGIN 6P[0m

[1mDescription[0m
       The GNU implementation of the [4mms[24m macro package is  part  of  the  [4mgroff[0m
       document  formatting system.  The [4mms[24m package is suitable for the compo‐
       sition of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.

       These [4mgroff[24m macros support cover page and table of contents generation,
       automatically numbered headings, several paragraph styles, a variety of
       text styling options, footnotes, and  multi‐column  page  layouts.   [4mms[0m
       supports the [4mtbl[24m(1), [4meqn[24m(1), [4mpic[24m(1), and [4mrefer[24m(1) preprocessors for in‐
       clusion of tables, mathematical equations, diagrams,  and  standardized
       bibliographic citations.

       This  implementation is mostly compatible with the documented interface
       and behavior of AT&T Unix Version 7 [4mms[24m.  Many  extensions  from  4.2BSD
       (Berkeley) and Tenth Edition Research Unix have been recreated.

[1mUsage[0m
       The  [4mms[24m  macro  package  expects a certain amount of structure: a well‐
       formed document contains at least one  paragraphing  or  heading  macro
       call.   To  compose a simple document from scratch, begin it by calling
       [1m.LP [22mor [1m.PP[22m.  Longer documents have a structure as follows.

       [1mDocument type[0m
              Calling the [1mRP [22mmacro at the beginning of your document puts  the
              document description (see below) on a cover page.  Otherwise, [4mms[0m
              places this information on the first page, followed  immediately
              by  the body text.  Some document types found in other [4mms[24m imple‐
              mentations are specific to AT&T or Berkeley, and  are  not  sup‐
              ported in [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m.

       [1mFormat and layout[0m
              By  setting  registers and strings, you can configure your docu‐
              ment’s typeface, margins,  spacing,  headers  and  footers,  and
              footnote  arrangement.   See  subsection  “Document control set‐
              tings” below.

       [1mDocument description[0m
              A document description consists of any of: a title, one or  more
              authors’  names  and affiliated institutions, an abstract, and a
              date or other identifier.  See subsection “Document  description
              macros” below.

       [1mBody text[0m
              The  main  matter  of  your document follows its description (if
              any).  [4mms[24m supports highly structured text  consisting  of  para‐
              graphs  interspersed  with  multi‐level headings (chapters, sec‐
              tions, subsections, and so forth) and augmented by lists,  foot‐
              notes,  tables,  diagrams, and similar material.  The preponder‐
              ance of subsections below covers these matters.

       [1mTable of contents[0m
              Macros enable the collection of entries for a table of  contents
              (or index) as the material they discuss appears in the document.
              You then call a macro to emit the table of contents at  the  end
              of your document.  The table of contents must necessarily follow
              the rest of the text since GNU [4mtroff[24m is a single‐pass formatter;
              it  thus  cannot  determine the page number of a division of the
              text until it has been set and output.  Since [4mms[24m output was  de‐
              signed  for  the production of hard copy, the traditional proce‐
              dure was to manually relocate the pages containing the table  of
              contents  between the cover page and the body text.  Today, page
              resequencing is more often done in the digital domain.  An index
              works similarly, but because it typically needs to be sorted af‐
              ter collection, its preparation requires separate processing.

   [1mDocument control settings[0m
       The following tables list the document control registers, strings,  and
       special characters.  For any parameter whose default is unsatisfactory,
       define it before calling any [4mms[24m macro other than [1mRP[22m.

       “Paper  format”  of  [4mgroff[24m(1).   The [1mPD [22mand [1mDD [22mregisters use the larger
       value if the vertical motion quantum of the output device is too coarse
       for  the smaller one; usually, this is the case only for output to ter‐

   [1mDocument description macros[0m
       Define  information describing the document by calling the macros below
       in the order shown; [1m.DA [22mor [1m.ND [22mcan be called to set the  document  date
       (or  other identifier) at any time before (a) the abstract, if present,
       or (b) its information is required in a header or footer.  Use of these
       macros  is  optional,  except that [1m.TL [22mis mandatory if any of [1m.RP[22m, [1m.AU[22m,
       [1m.AI[22m, or [1m.AB [22mis called, and [1m.AE [22mis mandatory if [1m.AB [22mis called.

       [1m.RP [22m[[1mno-repeat-info[22m] [[1mno-renumber[22m]
              Use the “report” (AT&T: “released paper”) format for your  docu‐
              ment,  creating  a separate cover page.  The default arrangement
              is to place most of  the  document  description  (title,  author
              names  and  institutions, and abstract, but not the date) at the
              top of the first page.  If the optional [1mno-repeat-info  [22margument
              is  given,  [4mms[24m  produces a cover page but does not repeat any of
              its information on subsequently (but see the [1mDA [22mmacro below  re‐
              garding the date).  Normally, [1m.RP [22msets the page number following
              the cover page to 1.  Specifying the optional [1mno-renumber  [22margu‐
              ment  suppresses  this alteration.  Optional arguments can occur
              in any order.  “[1mno[22m” is recognized as a synonym of [1mno-repeat-info[0m
              for AT&T compatibility.

       [1m.TL    [22mSpecify  the  document  title.   [4mms[24m collects text on input lines
              following this call into the title until reaching [1m.AU[22m, [1m.AB[22m, or a
              heading or paragraphing macro call.

       [1m.AU    [22mSpecify  an author’s name.  [4mms[24m collects text on input lines fol‐
              lowing this call into the author’s name until reaching [1m.AI[22m, [1m.AB[22m,
              another  [1m.AU[22m,  or a heading or paragraphing macro call.  Call it
              repeatedly to specify multiple authors.

       [1m.AI    [22mSpecify the preceding author’s institution.  An [1m.AU [22mcall is use‐
              fully  followed  by at most one [1m.AI [22mcall; if there are more, the
              last [1m.AI [22mcall controls.  [4mms[24m collects text on input lines follow‐
              ing  this call into the author’s institution until reaching [1m.AU[22m,
              [1m.AB[22m, or a heading or paragraphing macro call.

              Typeset the current date, or any  arguments  [4mx[24m,  in  the  center
              footer,  and,  if [1m.RP [22mis also called, left‐aligned at the end of
              the document description on the cover page.

       [1m.ND [22m[[4mx[24m ...]
              Typeset the current date, or any arguments [4mx[24m,  if  [1m.RP  [22mis  also
              called,  left‐aligned  at the end of the document description on
              the cover page.  This is [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m’s default.

       [1m.AB [22m[[1mno[22m]
              Begin the abstract.  [4mms[24m collects text on input  lines  following
              this  call into the abstract until reaching an [1m.AE [22mcall.  By de‐
              fault, [4mms[24m places the word “ABSTRACT”  centered  and  in  italics
              above the text of the abstract.  The optional argument “[1mno[22m” sup‐
              presses this heading.

       [1m.AE    [22mEnd the abstract.

   [1mText settings[0m
       The [1mFAM [22mstring, a GNU extension, sets the font family  for  body  text;
       the default is “[1mT[22m”.  The [1mPS [22mand [1mVS [22mregisters set the type size and ver‐
       tical spacing (distance between  text  baselines),  respectively.   The
       font  family  and  type  size are ignored on terminal devices.  Setting
       these parameters before the first call of a heading,  paragraphing,  or
       (non‐date)  document  description  macro  also applies them to headers,
       footers, and (for [1mFAM[22m) footnotes.

       The [1mHY [22mregister defines the automatic hyphenation mode used with the [1mhy[0m
       request.   Setting  [1m\n[HY]  [22mto [1m0 [22mis equivalent to using the [1mnh [22mrequest.
       This is a Tenth Edition Research Unix extension.

   [1mTypographical symbols[0m
       [4mms[24m provides a few strings to obtain typographical  symbols  not  easily
       entered with the keyboard.  These and many others are available as spe‐
       cial character escape sequences—see [4mgroff_char[24m(7).

       [1m\*[-]  [22mInterpolate an em dash.

       [1m\*[Q][0m
       [1m\*[U]  [22mInterpolate typographer’s quotation marks where  available,  and
              neutral  double  quotes  otherwise.  [1m\*[Q] [22mis the left quote and
              [1m\*[U] [22mthe right.

   [1mParagraphs[0m
       Paragraphing macros [4mbreak[24m, or terminate, any  pending  output  line  so
       that a new paragraph can begin.  Several paragraph types are available,
       differing in how indentation applies to them: to left, right,  or  both
       margins;  to  the first output line of the paragraph, all output lines,
       or all but the first.  All paragraphing macro calls cause the insertion
       of  vertical  space  in the amount stored in the [1mPD [22mregister, except at
       page or column breaks, or adjacent to displays.

       The [1mPORPHANS [22mregister defines the minimum number of  initial  lines  of
       any paragraph that must be kept together to avoid isolated lines at the
       bottom of a page.  If a new paragraph is started close to the bottom of
       a  page,  and  there  is insufficient space to accommodate [1m\n[PORPHANS][0m
       lines before an automatic page break, then a page break is  forced  be‐
       fore the start of the paragraph.  This is a GNU extension.

       [1m.LP    [22mSet a paragraph without any (additional) indentation.

       [1m.PP    [22mSet a paragraph with a first‐line left indentation in the amount
              stored in the [1mPI [22mregister.

       [1m.IP [22m[[4mmarker[24m [[4mwidth[24m]]
              Set a paragraph with a left indentation.  The optional [4mmarker[24m is
              not  indented  and is empty by default.  [4mwidth[24m overrides the in‐
              dentation amount in [1m\n[PI][22m; its default unit is “[1mn[22m”.  Once spec‐
              ified,  [4mwidth[24m applies to further [1m.IP [22mcalls until specified again
              or a heading or different paragraphing macro is called.

       [1m.QP    [22mSet a paragraph indented from both left  and  right  margins  by
              [1m\n[QI][22m.

       [1m.QS[0m
       [1m.QE    [22mBegin  ([1mQS[22m)  and  end  ([1mQE[22m) a region where each paragraph is in‐
              dented from both margins by [1m\n[QI][22m.  The text  between  [1m.QS  [22mand
              [1m.QE  [22mcan  be  structured  further  by  use of other paragraphing
              macros.

       [1m.XP    [22mSet an “exdented”  paragraph—one  with  a  left  indentation  of
              [1m\n[PI]  [22mon  every line [4mexcept[24m the first (also known as a hanging
              indent).  This is a Berkeley extension.

   [1mHeadings[0m
       Use headings to create a hierarchical structure for your document.  The
       [4mms[24m macros print headings in [1mbold [22musing the same font family and, by de‐
       fault, type size as the body text.  Headings  are  available  with  and
       without  automatic  numbering.  Text on input lines following the macro
       call becomes the heading’s title.  Call a paragraphing macro to end the
       heading text and start the section’s content.

       [1m.NH [22m[[4mdepth[24m]
              Set  an  automatically numbered heading.  [4mms[24m produces a numbered
              heading in the form [4ma[24m.[4mb[24m.[4mc[24m..., to any  level  desired,  with  the
              numbering of each depth increasing automatically and being reset
              to zero when a more significant depth is increased.  “[1m1[22m” is  the
              most  significant  or  coarsest  division of the document.  Only
              non‐zero values are output.  If [4mdepth[24m is omitted, it is taken to
              be  [1m1[22m.   If  you specify [4mdepth[24m such that an ascending gap occurs
              relative to the previous [1mNH [22mcall—that is, you “skip a depth”, as
              by  “[1m.NH  1[22m”  and  then “[1m.NH 3[22m”, [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m emits a warning on the
              standard error stream.

       [1m.NH S [4m[22mheading‐depth‐index[24m ...
              Alternatively, you can give [1mNH [22ma first argument of “[1mS[22m”, followed
              by  integers  to  number the heading depths explicitly.  Further
              automatic numbering, if used, resumes using  the  specified  in‐
              dices  as their predecessors.  This feature is a Berkeley exten‐
              sion.

       After [1m.NH [22mis called, the assigned  number  is  made  available  in  the
       strings [1mSN-DOT [22m(as it appears in a printed heading with default format‐
       ting, followed by a terminating period) and [1mSN-NO-DOT [22m(with the  termi‐
       nating period omitted).  These are GNU extensions.

       You  can  control the style used to print numbered headings by defining
       an appropriate alias for the string [1mSN-STYLE[22m.  By default, [1m\*[SN-STYLE][0m
       is aliased to [1m\*[SN-DOT][22m.  If you prefer to omit the terminating period
       from numbers appearing in  numbered  headings,  you  may  alias  it  to
       [1m\*[SN-NO-DOT][22m.   Any  such  change in numbering style becomes effective
       from the next use of  [1m.NH  [22mfollowing  redefinition  of  the  alias  for
       [1m\*[SN-STYLE][22m.  The formatted number of the current heading is available
       in [1m\*[SN] [22m(a feature first documented by Berkeley); this string facili‐
       tates  its  inclusion in, for example, table captions, equation labels,
       and [1m.XS[22m/[1m.XA[22m/[1m.XE [22mtable of contents entries.

       [1m.SH [22m[[4mdepth[24m]
              Set an unnumbered heading.  The optional [4mdepth[24m argument is a GNU
              extension  indicating  the  heading  depth  corresponding to the
              [4mdepth[24m argument of [1m.NH[22m.  It matches the type size  at  which  the
              heading  is  set to that of a numbered heading at the same depth
              when the [1m\n[GROWPS] [22mand [1m\n[PSINCR] [22mheading size adjustment mech‐
              anism is in effect.

       The  [1mPSINCR [22mregister defines an increment in type size to be applied to
       a heading at a lesser depth than that  specified  in  [1m\n[GROWPS][22m.   The
       value  of [1m\n[PSINCR] [22mshould be specified in points with the “[1mp[22m” scaling
       unit and may include a fractional component.

       The [1mGROWPS [22mregister defines the heading depth above which the type size
       increment  set by [1m\n[PSINCR] [22mbecomes effective.  For each heading depth
       less than the value of  [1m\n[GROWPS][22m,  the  type  size  is  increased  by
       [1m\n[PSINCR][22m.  Setting [1m\n[GROWPS] [22mto a value less than 2 disables the in‐
       cremental heading size feature.

       In other words, if the value of [1mGROWPS [22mregister  is  greater  than  the
       [4mdepth[24m  argument  to  a [1m.NH [22mor [1m.SH [22mcall, the type size of a heading pro‐
       duced by these macros increases by [1m\n[PSINCR] [22munits over [1m\n[PS]  [22mmulti‐
       plied by the difference of [1m\n[GROWPS] [22mand [4mdepth[24m.

       The  [1m\n[HORPHANS]  [22mregister  operates in conjunction with the [1mNH [22mand [1mSH[0m
       macros to inhibit the printing of isolated headings at the bottom of  a
       page;  it specifies the minimum number of lines of the subsequent para‐
       graph that must be kept on the same page as the heading.   If  insuffi‐
       cient  space remains on the current page to accommodate the heading and
       this number of lines of paragraph text, a page break is  forced  before
       the heading is printed.  Any display macro call or [4mtbl[24m, [4mpic[24m, or [4meqn[24m re‐
       gion between the heading and the subsequent paragraph  suppresses  this
       grouping.

   [1mTypeface and decoration[0m
       The  [4mms[24m macros provide a variety of ways to style text.  Attend closely
       to the ordering of arguments labeled [4mpre[24m and [4mpost,[24m which is  not  intu‐
       itive.  Support for [4mpre[24m arguments is a GNU extension.

       [1m.B [22m[[4mtext[24m [[4mpost[24m [[4mpre[24m]]]
              Style  [4mtext[24m in bold, followed by [4mpost[24m in the previous font style
              without intervening space, and preceded by [4mpre[24m similarly.  With‐
              out  arguments, [4mms[24m styles subsequent text in bold until the next
              paragraphing, heading, or no‐argument typeface macro call.

       [1m.R [22m[[4mtext[24m [[4mpost[24m [[4mpre[24m]]]
              As [1m.B[22m, but use the roman style (upright text of  normal  weight)
              instead of bold.  Argument recognition is a GNU extension.

       [1m.I [22m[[4mtext[24m [[4mpost[24m [[4mpre[24m]]]
              As [1m.B[22m, but use an italic or oblique style instead of bold.

       [1m.BI [22m[[4mtext[24m [[4mpost[24m [[4mpre[24m]]]
              As  [1m.B[22m,  but  use a bold italic or bold oblique style instead of
              upright bold.  This is a Tenth Edition Research Unix extension.

              Typeset [4mtext[24m and draw a box around it.  On terminal devices, re‐
              verse video is used instead.  If you want [4mtext[24m to contain space,
              use unbreakable space or horizontal motion escape sequences ([1m\~[22m,
              [1m\[4m[22mspace[24m, [1m\^[22m, [1m\|[22m, [1m\0[22m, or [1m\h[22m).

              large the type size as needed.

       [1m.SM    [22mSet subsequent text in smaller type (2 points smaller  than  the
              current size) until the next type size, paragraphing, or heading
              macro call.  You can specify this macro multiple times to reduce
              the type size as needed.

       [1m.NL    [22mSet subsequent text at the normal type size ([1m\n[PS][22m).

       When  [4mpre[24m  is used, a hyphenation control escape sequence [1m\% [22mthat would
       ordinarily start [4mtext[24m must start [4mpre[24m instead.

       [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m also offers strings to begin and end super‐ and  subscripting.
       These are GNU extensions.

   [1mIndented regions[0m
       You  may  need to indent a region of text while otherwise formatting it
       normally.  Indented regions can be nested.

       [1m.RS    [22mBegin a region where headings, paragraphs, and displays are  in‐
              dented (further) by [1m\n[PI][22m.

       [1m.RE    [22mEnd the (next) most recent indented region.

   [1mKeeps, boxed keeps, and displays[0m
       On occasion, you may want to [4mkeep[24m several lines of text, or a region of
       a document, together on a single page,  preventing  an  automatic  page
       break  within certain boundaries.  This can cause a page break to occur
       earlier than it normally would.

       You can alternatively specify a [4mfloating[24m [4mkeep:[24m if a keep cannot fit  on
       the  current  page, [4mms[24m holds its contents and allows text following the
       keep (in the source document) to fill in the remainder of  the  current
       page.  When the page breaks, whether by reaching the end or [1mbp [22mrequest,
       [4mms[24m puts the floating keep at the beginning of the next page.

       [1m.KS    [22mBegin a keep.

       [1m.KF    [22mBegin a floating keep.

       [1m.KE    [22mEnd (floating) keep.

       As an alternative to the keep mechanism, the [1mne [22mrequest forces  a  page
       break  if  there is not at least the amount of vertical space specified
       in its argument remaining on the page.

       A [4mboxed[24m [4mkeep[24m has a frame drawn around it.

       [1m.B1    [22mBegin a keep with a box drawn around it.

       [1m.B2    [22mEnd boxed keep.

       Boxed keep macros cause breaks; if you need to box  a  word  or  phrase
       within  a  line, see the [1mBX [22mmacro in section “Highlighting” above.  Box
       lines are drawn as close as possible to the text they enclose  so  that
       they  are  usable  within paragraphs.  If you wish to place one or more
       paragraphs in a boxed keep, you may improve their appearance by calling
       [1m.B1 [22mafter the first paragraphing macro, and by adding a small amount of
       vertical space before calling [1m.B2[22m.

       If you want a boxed keep to float, you will need to enclose the [1m.B1 [22mand
       [1m.B2 [22mcalls within a pair of [1m.KF [22mand [1m.KE [22mcalls.

       [4mDisplays[24m  turn  off  filling;  lines of verse or program code are shown
       with their lines broken as in the source document without requiring  [1mbr[0m
       requests  between  lines.  Displays can be kept on a single page or al‐
       lowed to break across pages.  The [1mDS [22mmacro begins a kept display of the
       layout  specified  in  its  first argument; non‐kept displays are begun
       with dedicated macros corresponding to their layout.

       spacing prior to a section heading.  The [1mDI [22mregister is  a  GNU  exten‐
       sion;  its value is an indentation applied to displays created with [1m.DS[0m
       and [1m.ID [22mwithout arguments, to “[1m.DS I[22m” without an indentation  argument,
       and to equations set with “[1m.EQ I[22m”.  Changes to either register take ef‐
       fect at the next display boundary.

   [1mTables, figures, equations, and references[0m
       The [4mms[24m package is often used with the [4mtbl[24m, [4mpic[24m,  [4meqn[24m,  and  [4mrefer[24m  pre‐
       processors.  The [1m\n[DD] [22mdistance is also applied to regions of the doc‐
       ument preprocessed with [4meqn[24m, [4mpic[24m, and [4mtbl[24m.  Mark text  meant  for  pre‐
       processors  by enclosing it in pairs of tokens as follows, with nothing
       between the dot and the macro name.  The preprocessors match these  to‐
       kens only at the start of an input line.

       [1m.TS [22m[[1mH[22m]
       [1m.TE    [22mDemarcate  a table to be processed by the [4mtbl[24m preprocessor.  The
              optional [1mH [22margument instructs [4mms[24m to  repeat  table  rows  (often
              column headings) at the top of each new page the table spans, if
              applicable; calling the [1mTH [22mmacro marks the  end  of  such  rows.
              [4mtbl[24m(1)  provides  a  comprehensive reference to the preprocessor

              the preprocessor and the format of its bibliographic database.

       When  [4mrefer[24m  emits  collected  references (as might be done on a “Works
       Cited” page), it interpolates the string [1m\*[REFERENCES]  [22mas  an  unnum‐
       bered heading ([1m.SH[22m).

       Attempting  to  place  a multi‐page table inside a keep can lead to un‐
       pleasant results, particularly if the [4mtbl[24m “[1mallbox[22m” option is used.

   [1mFootnotes[0m
       A footnote is typically anchored to a place in the text with a  [4mmarker,[0m
       which is a small integer, a symbol, or arbitrary user‐specified text.

       [1m\**    [22mPlace  an  [4mautomatic[24m  [4mnumber,[24m an automatically generated numeric
              footnote marker, in the text.  Each time this string is interpo‐
              lated, the number it produces increments by one.  Automatic num‐
              bers start at 1.  This is a Berkeley extension.

       Enclose the footnote text in [1mFS [22mand [1mFE [22mmacro calls to  set  it  at  the
       nearest available “foot”, or bottom, of a text column or page.

              Begin  a footnote.  The [1m.FS-MARK [22mhook (see below) is called with
              any supplied [4mmarker[24m argument, which is then also placed  at  the
              beginning  of the footnote text.  If [4mmarker[24m is omitted, the next
              pending automatic number enqueued  by  interpolation  of  the  [1m*[0m
              string is used, and if none exists, nothing is prefixed.

       [1m.FE    [22mEnd footnote text.

       [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m provides a hook macro, [1mFS-MARK[22m, for user‐determined operations
       to be performed when the [1mFS [22mmacro is called.  It is passed the same ar‐
       guments as [1m.FS [22mitself.  By default, this macro has an empty definition.
       [1m.FS-MARK [22mis a GNU extension.

       Footnote text is formatted as paragraphs are, using  analogous  parame‐
       ters.   The  registers  [1mFI[22m, [1mFPD[22m, [1mFPS[22m, and [1mFVS [22mcorrespond to [1mPI[22m, [1mPD[22m, [1mPS[22m,
       and [1mVS[22m, respectively; [1mFPD[22m, [1mFPS[22m, and [1mFVS [22mare GNU extensions.

       The [1mFF [22mregister controls the formatting of automatically numbered foot‐
       note paragraphs, and those for which [1m.FS [22mis given a [4mmarker[24m argument, at
       the bottom of a column or page as follows.

                     ment,  as  a  superscript (on typesetter devices) or sur‐
                     rounded by square brackets (on terminals).  The  footnote
                     paragraph  is indented as with [1m.PP [22mif there is an [1m.FS [22mar‐
                     gument or an automatic number, and as with [1m.LP [22motherwise.
                     This is the default.

              1      As  [1m0[22m,  but set the marker as regular text, and follow an
                     automatic number with a period.

              2      As [1m1[22m, but without indentation (like [1m.LP[22m).

              3      As [1m1[22m, but set the  footnote  paragraph  with  the  marker

   [1mHeaders and footers[0m
       There are multiple ways to produce headers and footers.  One is to  de‐
       fine  the  strings  [1mLH[22m,  [1mCH[22m,  and [1mRH [22mto set the left, center, and right
       headers, respectively; and [1mLF[22m, [1mCF[22m, and [1mRF [22mto set the left, center,  and
       right  footers.   This approach suffices for documents that do not dis‐
       tinguish odd‐ and even‐numbered pages.

       Another method is to call macros that set headers or footers  for  odd‐
       or  even‐numbered  pages.   Each  such macro takes a delimited argument
       separating the left, center, and right header or footer texts from each
       other.   You  can  replace the neutral apostrophes (') shown below with
       any character not appearing in the header or footer text.  These macros
       are Berkeley extensions.

       [1m.OH [22m'[4mleft[24m'[4mcenter[24m'[4mright[24m'
       [1m.OF [22m'[4mleft[24m'[4mcenter[24m'[4mright[24m'
       [1m.EH [22m'[4mleft[24m'[4mcenter[24m'[4mright[24m'
       [1m.EF [22m'[4mleft[24m'[4mcenter[24m'[4mright[24m'
              The  [1mOH  [22mand [1mEH [22mmacros define headers for odd‐ (recto) and even‐
              numbered (verso) pages, respectively; the [1mOF [22mand [1mEF  [22mmacros  de‐
              fine footers for them.

       With  either  method,  a percent sign [1m% [22min header or footer text is re‐
       placed by the current page number.  By default, [4mms[24m places no header  on
       a page numbered “1” (regardless of its number format).

       [1m.P1    [22mTypeset  the header even on page 1.  To be effective, this macro
              must be called before the header trap is sprung on any page num‐
              bered “1”.  This is a Berkeley extension.

       For  even  greater  flexibility,  [4mms[24m permits redefinition of the macros
       called when the page header and footer traps  are  sprung.   [1mPT  [22m(“page
       trap”)  is called by [4mms[24m when the header is to be written, and [1mBT [22m(“bot‐
       tom trap”) when the footer is to be.  The [4mgroff[24m page location trap that
       [4mms[24m  sets up to format the header also calls the (normally undefined) [1mHD[0m
       macro after [1m.PT[22m; you can define [1m.HD [22mif you need  additional  processing
       after  setting  the  header.  The [1mHD [22mhook is a Berkeley extension.  Any
       such macros you (re)define must implement  any  desired  specialization
       for odd‐, even‐, or first numbered pages.

   [1mTab stops[0m
       Use the [1mta [22mrequest to set tab stops as needed.

       [1m.TA    [22mReset  the  tab stops to the [4mms[24m default (every 5 ens).  Redefine
              this macro to create a different set of default tab stops.

   [1mMargins[0m
       Control margins using the registers summarized in the “Margins” portion
       of the table in section “Document control settings” above.  There is no
       setting for the right margin; the combination of page offset [1m\n[PO] [22mand
       line length [1m\n[LL] [22mdetermines it.

   [1mMultiple columns[0m
       [4mms[24m  can set text in as many columns as reasonably fit on the page.  The
       following macros force a page break if a multi‐column layout is  active
       when  they  are called.  [1m\n[MINGW] [22mis the default minimum gutter width;
       it is a GNU extension.  When multiple columns are in use, keeps and the
       [1mHORPHANS  [22mand [1mPORPHANS [22mregisters work with respect to column breaks in‐
       stead of page breaks.

       [1m.1C    [22mArrange page text in a single column (the default).

       [1m.2C    [22mArrange page text in two columns.

       [1m.MC [22m[[4mcolumn‐width[24m [[4mgutter‐width[24m]]
              Arrange page text in multiple columns.  If you specify no  argu‐
              ments,  it  is  equivalent  to the [1m2C [22mmacro.  Otherwise, [4mcolumn‐[0m
              [4mwidth[24m is the width of each column and [4mgutter‐width[24m is the  mini‐
              mum distance between columns.

   [1mCreating a table of contents[0m
       Define  an  entry  to appear in the table of contents by bracketing its
       text between calls to the [1mXS [22mand [1mXE [22mmacros.  A typical  application  is
       to  call  them  immediately  after [1mNH [22mor [1mSH [22mand repeat the heading text
       within them.  The [1mXA [22mmacro, used within [1m.XS[22m/[1m.XE [22mpairs,  supplements  an
       entry—for instance, when it requires multiple output lines, whether be‐
       cause a heading is too long to fit or because style dictates that  page
       numbers  not be repeated.  You may wish to indent the text thus wrapped
       to correspond to its heading depth; this can be done in the entry  text
       by  prefixing it with tabs or horizontal motion escape sequences, or by
       providing a second argument to the [1mXA [22mmacro.  [1m.XS [22mand [1m.XA [22mautomatically
       associate the page number where they are called with the text following
       them, but they accept arguments to override this behavior.  At the  end
       of  the  document, call [1mTC [22mor [1mPX [22mto emit the table of contents; [1m.TC [22mre‐
       sets the page number to [1mi [22m(Roman numeral one), and then calls [1mPX[22m.   All
       of these macros are Berkeley extensions.

       [1m.XS [22m[[4mpage‐number[24m]
       [1m.XA [22m[[4mpage‐number[24m [[4mindentation[24m]]
       [1m.XE    [22mBegin,  supplement, and end a table of contents entry.  Each en‐
              try is associated with [4mpage‐number[24m (otherwise the  current  page
              number); a [4mpage‐number[24m of “[1mno[22m” prevents a leader and page number
              from being emitted for that entry.  Use of [1m.XA [22mwithin [1m.XS[22m/[1m.XE [22mis
              optional; it can be repeated.  If [4mindentation[24m is present, a sup‐
              plemental entry is indented by that amount; ens are  assumed  if
              no  unit  is indicated.  Text on input lines between [1m.XS [22mand [1m.XE[0m
              is stored for later recall by [1m.PX[22m.

       [1m.PX [22m[[1mno[22m]
              Switch to single‐column layout.  Unless “[1mno[22m” is specified,  cen‐
              ter  and  interpolate [1m\*[TOC] [22min bold and two points larger than
              the body text.  Emit the table of contents entries.

       [1m.TC [22m[[1mno[22m]
              Set the page number to 1, the page number  format  to  lowercase
              Roman numerals, and call [1mPX [22m(with a “[1mno[22m” argument, if present).

       The remaining features in this subsection are GNU extensions.  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[0m
       obviates the need to repeat heading text after [1m.XS [22mcalls.  Call [1m.XN [22mand
       [1m.XH  [22mafter  [1m.NH [22mand [1m.SH[22m, respectively.  Text to be appended to the for‐
       matted section heading, but not to appear in the table of contents  en‐
       try, can follow these calls.

       [1m.XN [4m[22mheading‐text[0m
              Format [4mheading‐text[24m and create a corresponding table of contents
              entry; the indentation is computed from the  [4mdepth[24m  argument  of
              the preceding [1mNH [22mcall.

       [1m.XH [4m[22mdepth[24m [4mheading‐text[0m
              As [1m.XN[22m, but use [4mdepth[24m to determine the indentation.

       [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m  encourages  customization of table of contents entry produc‐
       tion.  (Re‐)define any of the following macros as desired.

       [1m.XN-REPLACEMENT [4m[22mheading‐text[0m
       [1m.XH-REPLACEMENT [4m[22mdepth[24m [4mheading‐text[0m
              These hook macros implement [1m.XN [22mand [1m.XH[22m, and  call  [1mXN-INIT  [22mand
              [1mXH-INIT[22m,  respectively,  then  call [1mXH-UPDATE-TOC [22mwith the argu‐
              ments given them.

       [1m.XH-INIT[0m
       [1m.XN-INIT[0m
              These hook macros do nothing by default.

       [1m.XH-UPDATE-TOC [4m[22mdepth[24m [4mheading‐text[0m
              Bracket [4mheading‐text[24m with [1mXS [22mand [1mXE [22mcalls, indenting it by 2 ens
              per level of [4mdepth[24m beyond the first.

       You  can  customize  the style of the leader that bridges each table of
       contents entry with its page number; define the [1mTC-LEADER [22mspecial char‐
       acter  by  using  the  [1mchar [22mrequest.  A typical leader combines the dot
       glyph “[1m.[22m” with a horizontal motion escape sequence to spread the  dots.
       The width of the page number field is stored in the [1mTC-MARGIN [22mregister.

[1mDifferences from AT&T [4mms[0m
       The  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m macros are an independent reimplementation, using no AT&T
       code.  Since they take advantage of the  extended  features  of  [4mgroff[24m,
       they  cannot  be  used with AT&T [4mtroff[24m.  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m supports features de‐
       scribed above as Berkeley and Tenth Edition Research  Unix  extensions,
       and adds several of its own.

       •  The  internals  of  [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m  differ from the internals of AT&T [4mms[24m.
          Documents that depend upon implementation details of AT&T [4mms[24m may not
          format  properly  with  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m.  Such details include macros whose
          function was not documented in the AT&T [4mms[24m manual (“Typing Documents
          on  the  UNIX System: Using the -ms Macros with Troff and Nroff”, M.
          E. Lesk, Bell Laboratories, 1978).

       •  The error‐handling policy of [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m is to detect  and  report  er‐
          rors, rather than to ignore them silently.

       •  Tenth  Edition  Research Unix supported [1mP1[22m/[1mP2 [22mmacros to bracket code
          examples; [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m does not.

       •  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m does not work in GNU [4mtroff[24m’s AT&T compatibility  mode.   If
          loaded  when that mode is enabled, it aborts processing with a diag‐
          nostic message.

       •  Multiple line spacing is not supported.  Use a larger vertical spac‐
          ing instead.

       •  [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m uses the same header and footer defaults in both [4mnroff[24m and
          [4mtroff[24m modes as AT&T [4mms[24m does in [4mtroff[24m mode; AT&T’s default  in  [4mnroff[0m
          mode  is to put the date, in U.S. traditional format (e.g., “January
          1, 2021”), in the center footer (the [1mCF [22mstring).

       •  Many [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m macros, including those for paragraphs, headings,  and
          displays,  cause  a reset of paragraph rendering parameters, and may
          change the indentation; they do so not by incrementing or decrement‐
          ing  it,  but by setting it absolutely.  This can cause problems for
          documents that define additional macros of their own that try to ma‐
          nipulate indentation.  Use [1m.RS [22mand [1m.RE [22minstead of the [1min [22mrequest.

       •  AT&T [4mms[24m interpreted the values of the registers [1mPS [22mand [1mVS [22min points,
          and did not support the use of scaling units with  them.   [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[0m
          interprets values of the registers [1mPS[22m, [1mVS[22m, [1mFPS[22m, and [1mFVS[22m, equal to or
          larger than 1,000 (one thousand)  as  decimal  fractions  multiplied
          by  1,000.   (Register  values  are converted to and stored as basic
          units.  See  “Measurements”  in  the  [4mgroff[24m  Texinfo  manual  or  in
          [4mgroff[24m(7)).   This  threshold  makes use of a scaling unit with these
          parameters practical for high‐resolution  devices  while  preserving
          backward  compatibility.  It also permits expression of non‐integral
          type sizes.  For example, “[1mgroff -rPS=10.5p[22m” at the shell prompt  is
          equivalent  to  placing “[1m.nr PS 10.5p[22m” at the beginning of the docu‐
          ment.

       •  AT&T [4mms[24m’s [1mAU [22mmacro  supported  arguments  used  with  some  document
          types; [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m does not.

       •  Right‐aligned  displays  are available.  The AT&T [4mms[24m manual observes
          that “it is tempting to assume that “[1m.DS R[22m” will right adjust lines,
          but it doesn’t work”.  In [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m, it does.

       •  To  make  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m use the default page offset (which also specifies
          the left margin), the [1mPO [22mregister  must  stay  undefined  until  the
          first  [4mms[24m  macro  is called.  This implies that [1m\n[PO] [22mshould not be
          used early in the document, unless it is changed also: accessing  an
          undefined register automatically defines it.

       •  [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m supports the [1mPN [22mregister, but it is not necessary; you can
          access the page number via the usual [1m% [22mregister and  invoke  the  [1maf[0m
          request  to assign a different format to it if desired.  (If you re‐
          define the [4mms[24m [1mPT [22mmacro and desire special treatment of certain  page
          numbers—like  “[1m1[22m”—you  may  need  to handle a non‐Arabic page number
          format, as [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m’s [1m.PT [22mdoes; see the macro package source.  [4mgroff[0m
          [4mms[24m aliases the [1mPN [22mregister to [1m%[22m.)

       •  The  AT&T [4mms[24m manual documents registers [1mCW [22mand [1mGW [22mas setting the de‐
          fault column width and “intercolumn gap”,  respectively,  and  which
          applied when [1m.MC [22mwas called with fewer than two arguments.  [4mgroff[24m [4mms[0m
          instead treats [1m.MC [22mwithout arguments as synonymous with  [1m.2C[22m;  there
          is  thus  no occasion for a default column width register.  Further,
          the [1mMINGW [22mregister and the second argument to [1m.MC [22mspecify a  [4mminimum[0m
          space between columns, not the fixed gutter width of AT&T [4mms[24m.

       •  The  AT&T  [4mms[24m  manual did not document the [1mQI [22mregister; Berkeley and
          [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m do.

       •  The register [1mGS [22mis set to 1 by the [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m macros, but is not  used
          by  the  AT&T  [4mms[24m package.  Documents that need to determine whether
          they are being formatted with [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m  or  another  implementation
          should test this register.

   [1mUnix Version 7 macros not implemented by [4mgroff[24m [4mms[0m
       Several  macros  described  in  the Unix Version 7 [4mms[24m documentation are
       unimplemented by [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m because they are specific to the requirements
       of  documents  produced  internally by Bell Laboratories, some of which
       also require a glyph for the Bell System logo that [4mgroff[24m does not  sup‐
       port.   These macros implemented several document type formats ([1mEG[22m, [1mIM[22m,
       [1mMF[22m, [1mMR[22m, [1mTM[22m, [1mTR[22m), were meaningful only in conjunction with  the  use  of
       certain  document  types  ([1mAT[22m,  [1mCS[22m,  [1mCT[22m, [1mOK[22m, [1mSG[22m), stored the postal ad‐
       dresses of Bell Labs sites ([1mHO[22m, [1mIH[22m, [1mMH[22m, [1mPY[22m, [1mWH[22m), or lacked a stable de‐
       finition over time ([1mUX[22m).

[1mLegacy features[0m
       [4mgroff[24m  [4mms[24m  retains some legacy features solely to support formatting of
       historical documents; contemporary ones should  not  use  them  because
       they can render poorly.  See [4mgroff_char[24m(7) instead.

   [1mAT&T [4mms[24m accent mark strings[0m
       AT&T [4mms[24m defined accent mark strings as follows.

[1mNaming conventions[0m
       The  following  conventions  are used for names of macros, strings, and
       registers.  External names available to documents that use the [4mgroff[24m [4mms[0m
       macros contain only uppercase letters and digits.

       Internally, the macros are divided into modules.  Conventions for iden‐
       tifier names are as follows.

       •  Names used only within one module are of the form [4mmodule[24m[1m*[4m[22mname[24m.

       •  Names used outside the module in which they are defined are  of  the
          form [4mmodule[24m[1m@[4m[22mname[24m.

       •  Names  associated  with  a  particular  environment  are of the form
          [4menvironment[24m[1m:[4m[22mname[24m; these are used only within the [1mpar [22mmodule.

       •  [4mname[24m does not have a module prefix.

       •  Constructed  names  used  to  implement  arrays  are  of  the   form
          [4marray[24m[1m![4m[22mindex[24m.

       Thus the [4mgroff[24m [4mms[24m macros reserve the following names:

       •  Names containing the characters [1m*[22m, [1m@[22m, and [1m:[22m.

       •  Names containing only uppercase letters and digits.

       groff_rfc1345 - special character names from RFC 1345 and Vim digraphs

[1mDescription[0m
       The  file  [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m  defines special character escape sequences for
       [4mgroff[24m(7) based on the glyph mnemonics specified in RFC 1345 and the di‐
       graph table of the text editor Vim.  Each escape sequence translates to
       a Unicode code point, and will render correctly if the underlying  font
       is a Unicode font that covers the code point.

       For example, “[1m\[Rx][22m” is the “recipe” or “prescription take” symbol, and
       maps to the code point U+211E.  [4mgroff[24m lets you write it as  “[1m\[u211E][22m”,
       but “[1m\[Rx][22m” is more mnemonic.

       For   a  list  of  the  glyph  names  provided,  please  see  the  file
       [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m, which contains definitions of the form
              .char \[Rx] \[u211E]    \" PRESCRIPTION TAKE
       where [1m.char[22m’s first argument defines a [4mgroff[24m special  character  escape
       sequence  with  a mnemonic glyph name, its second argument is a special
       character escape sequence based on the code point, and the comment  de‐
       scribes the glyph defined.

       The RFC 1345 glyph names cover a wide range of Unicode code points, in‐
       cluding supplemental Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic,  Hiragana,
       Katakana,  and  Bopomofo  letters, punctuation, math notation, currency
       symbols, industrial and entertainment icons, and box‐drawing symbols.

       The Vim digraph table is practically a subset of RFC 1345  (being  lim‐
       ited  to two‐character mnemonics), but, as a newer implementation, adds
       four mnemonics not specified in the RFC (the horizontal  ellipsis,  the
       Euro sign, and two mappings for the rouble sign).  These have also been
       added to [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m.

       [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m contains a total of 1,696 glyph names.  It is not an error
       to load [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m if your font does not have all the glyphs, as long
       as it contains the glyphs that you actually use in your document.

       The RFC 1345 mnemonics are not identical in every case to the  mappings
       for special character glyph names that are built in to [4mgroff[24m; for exam‐
       ple, “[1m\[<<][22m” means the “much less than” sign (U+226A) when [4mrfc1345.tmac[0m
       is  not loaded and this special character is not otherwise defined by a
       document or macro  package.   [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m  redefines  “[1m\[<<][22m”  to  the
       “left‐pointing    double   angle   quotation   mark”   (U+00AB).    See
       [4mgroff_char[24m(7) for the full list of predefined special character  escape
       sequences.

   [1mUsage[0m
       Load  the  [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m  file.  This can be done by either adding “[1m.mso[0m
       [1mrfc1345.tmac[22m” to your document before the first use of any of the glyph
       names  the  macro  file  defines,  or  by using the [4mtroff[24m(1) option “[1m-m[0m
       [1mrfc1345[22m” from the shell.

   [1mBugs[0m
       As the [4mgroff[24m Texinfo manual notes, “[o]nly the current font is  checked
       for  ligatures  and  kerns;  neither special fonts nor entities defined
       with the [1mchar [22mrequest (and its siblings) are taken into account.”  Many
       of  the  characters defined in [4mrfc1345.tmac[24m are accented Latin letters,
       and will be affected by this deficiency, producing subpar typography.

       groff_trace - macros for debugging GNU [4mroff[24m documents

[1mSynopsis[0m
       [1mgroff -m trace [22m[[4moption[24m ...] [[4mfile[24m ...]

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mtrace[24m  is  a macro package for the [4mgroff[24m(7) document formatting system,
       designed as an aid for debugging documents written in its language.  It
       issues  a  message  to the standard error stream upon entry to and exit
       from each macro call.  This can ease the process of isolating errors in
       macro definitions.

       Activate  the  package by specifying the command‐line option “[1m-m trace[22m”
       to the formatter program (often [4mgroff[24m(1)).  You can achieve finer  con‐
       trol  by  including  the macro file within the document; invoke the [1mmso[0m
       request, as in “[1m.mso trace.tmac[22m”.  Only macros that are  defined  after
       this  invocation  are  traced.   If the [1mtrace-full [22mregister is set to a
       true value, as with the command‐line option “[1m-r trace-full=1[22m”, register
       and  string  assignments,  along  with  some other requests, are traced
       also.  If another macro package should be traced as  well,  specify  it
       after “[1m-m trace[22m” on the command line.

       The  macro  file  [4mtrace.tmac[24m is unusual because it does not contain any
       macros to be called by a user.  Instead, [4mgroff[24m’s macro  definition  and
       alteration  facilities  are  wrapped  such that they display diagnostic
       messages.

   [1mLimitations[0m
       Because [4mtrace.tmac[24m wraps the [1mde [22mrequest (and its cousins), macro  argu‐
       ments are expanded one level more.  This causes problems if an argument
       uses four or more backslashes to delay interpretation of an escape  se‐
       quence.  For example, the macro call
              .foo \\\\n[bar]
       normally  passes  “\\n[bar]”  to macro “foo”, but with [1mde [22mredefined, it
       passes “\n[bar]” instead.

       The solution to this problem is to use [4mgroff[24m’s [1m\E [22mescape  sequence,  an
       escape character that is not interpreted in copy mode.
              .foo \En[bar]

[1mExamples[0m
       We will illustrate [4mtrace.tmac[24m using the shell’s “here document” feature
       to supply [4mgroff[24m with a document on the standard input stream.  Since we
       are  interested  only  in diagnostic messages appearing on the standard
       error stream, we discard the formatted output by redirecting the  stan‐
       dard output stream to [4m/dev/null[24m.

   [1mObserving nested macro calls[0m
       Macro  calls  can  be  nested,  even with themselves.  Tracing recurses
       along with them; this feature can help to detangle complex call stacks.

              $ [1mcat <<EOF | groff -m trace > /dev/null[0m
              [1m.de countdown[0m

               *** trace exit: .countdown "3"

   [1mTracing with the mso request[0m
       Now let us activate tracing within the document, not  with  a  command‐
       line  option.   We  might do this when using a macro package like [4mms[24m or
       [4mmom[24m, where we may not want to be distracted  by  traces  of  macros  we
       didn’t write.

              $ [1mcat <<EOF | groff ‐ms > /dev/null[0m
              [1m.LP[0m
              [1mThis is my introductory paragraph.[0m

              [1m.de Mymac[0m
              [1m..[0m

              [1m.PP[0m

               *** de trace enter: .Mymac
               *** trace exit: .Mymac

       As  tracing  was  not yet active when the macros “LP” and “PP” were de‐
       fined (by [4ms.tmac[24m), their calls were not traced; contrast with the macro
       “Mymac”.

       This manual page describes the GNU [4mwww[24m macro package, which is part  of
       the  [4mgroff[24m(7) document formatting system.  This macro file is automati‐
       cally loaded by the default [4mtroffrc[24m file when  the  formatter  (usually
       [4mgroff[24m(1))  is  called with either of the options [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml[22m.  To
       see hyperlinks in action, format this man page using one of  those  op‐
       tions.

       This  document  is  a basic guide; the HTML output driver ([4mgrohtml[24m) re‐
       mains in an alpha state.  It has been included with the distribution to
       encourage testing.

       Here is a summary of the functions found in this macro set.

       .ALN         place links on left of main text.
       .LNS         start a new two‐column table with links in the left.

       .LNE         end the two‐column table.
       .LINKSTYLE   initialize default URL attributes.

[1mMacros[0m
       [1m.JOBNAME filename[0m
              Split output into multiple HTML files.  A file is split whenever
              a .SH or .NH 1 is encountered.  Its argument is  the  file  stem
              name  for  future  output  files.   This option is equivalent to
              [4mgrohtml[24m’s [1m-j [22moption.

       [1m.HX n  [22mSpecify the cut off depth when  generating  links  from  section
              headings.   For example, a parameter of 2 would cause [4mgrohtml[24m to
              generate a list of links for [1m.NH 1 [22mand [1m.NH 2 [22mbut not for  [1m.NH 3[22m.
              Whereas

                     .HX 0

              tells  [4mgrohtml[24m  that  no heading links should be created at all.
              Another method for turning automatic headings off is by  issuing
              the command‐line switch [1m-P-l [22mto [4mgroff[24m.

       [1m.BCL [4m[22mforeground[24m [4mbackground[24m [4mactive[24m [4mnot‐visited[24m [4mvisited[0m
              This macro takes five parameters: foreground, background, active
              hypertext link, hypertext link not yet visited, and visited  hy‐
              pertext link colour.

       [1m.BGIMG imagefile[0m
              the only parameter to this macro is the background image file.

       [1m.URL url [description] [after][0m
              generates  a URL using either one, two, or three arguments.  The
              first parameter is the actual URL, the second is the name of the
              link,  and the third is optional stuff to be printed immediately
              afterwards.  If [1mdescription [22mand [1mafter [22mare absent  then  the  [1mURL[0m
              becomes the anchor text.  Hyphenation is disabled while printing
              the actual URL; explicit breakpoints should be inserted with the
              [1m\: [22mescape sequence.  Here is how to encode foo:

                     [1m.URL http://\:foo\:.org/ foo :[0m

              If this is processed by a device other than [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml [22mit
              appears as:

                     foo ⟨http://foo.org⟩:

              The URL macro can be of any type; for example, we can  reference
              Eric Raymond’s [4mpic[24m guide by:

                     [1m.URL pic\:.html "Eric Raymond's pic guide"[0m

       [1m.MTO address [description] [after][0m
              Generate  an email HTML reference.  The first argument is manda‐
              tory as the email address.  The optional second argument is  the
              text  you  see  in your browser.  If an empty argument is given,
              [1maddress [22mis used instead.  An optional third  argument  is  stuff
              printed  immediately  afterwards.  Hyphenation is disabled while
              printing the actual email address.  For example, Joe User can be
              achieved by the following macro:

                     [1m.MTO joe@user.org "Joe User"[0m

              All  URLs currently are treated as consuming no textual space in
              [4mgroff[24m.  This could be considered as a bug since it  causes  some
              problems.   To  circumvent  this,  [1mwww.tmac [22minserts a zero‐width
              character which expands to a harmless space (only  if  run  with
              [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml[22m).

       [1m.FTP url [description] [after][0m
              indicates that data can be obtained via FTP.  The first argument
              is the URL and the second is the browser text.   A  third  argu‐
              ment, similar to the macros above, is intended for stuff printed
              immediately afterwards.  The second and the third parameter  are
              optional.   Hyphenation  is  disabled  while printing the actual
              URL.  As an example, here is the location of the GNU FTP server.
              The macro example above can be specified as:

                     [1m.FTP ftp://\:ftp\:.gnu\:.org/ "GNU FTP server" .[0m

       [1m.TAG name[0m
              Generates  an HTML name tag from its argument.  This can then be
              referenced using the URL macro.  As you can see, you  must  pre‐
              cede  the  tag  name with [1m# [22msince it is a local reference.  This
              link was achieved via placing  a  TAG  in  the  URL  description
              above; the source looks like this:

                     .TP
                     .B URL
                     generates
                     .TAG URL
                     a URL using either two or three arguments.
                     ...

       [1m.IMG [-R|-L|-C] filename [width] [height][0m
              Include  a picture into the document.  The first argument is the
              horizontal location: right, left, or center  ([1m-R[22m,  [1m-L[22m,  or  [1m-C[22m).
              Alignment  is  centered by default ([1m-C[22m).  The second argument is
              the filename.  The optional third and fourth arguments  are  the
              width and height.  If the width is absent it defaults to 1 inch.
              If the height is absent it defaults to  the  width.   This  maps
              onto  an HTML img tag.  If you are including a PNG image then it
              is advisable to use the [1mPIMG [22mmacro.

       [1m.PIMG [-R|-L|-C] filename [width [height]][0m
              Include an image in PNG format.  This macro  takes  exactly  the
              same  parameters as the [1mIMG [22mmacro; it has the advantage of work‐
              ing with PostScript and HTML devices also since it can automati‐
              cally convert the image into the EPS format, using the following
              programs of the [1mnetpbm [22mpackage: [1mpngtopnm[22m, [1mpnmcrop[22m, and  [1mpnmtops[22m.
              If  the  document  isn’t  processed with [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml [22mit is
              necessary to use the [1m-U [22moption of [4mgroff[24m.

       [1m.MPIMG [-R|-L] [-G gap] filename [width [height]][0m
              Place a PNG image on the margin and wrap text  around  it.   The
              first parameters are optional.  The alignment: left or right ([1m-L[0m
              or [1m-R[22m) specifies the margin where the picture is placed at.  The
              default  alignment is left ([1m-L[22m).  Optionally, [1m-G [4m[22mgap[24m can be used
              to arrange a gap between the picture and  the  text  that  wraps
              around it.  The default gap width is zero.
              The  first  non‐optional argument is the filename.  The optional
              following arguments are the width and height.  If the  width  is
              absent  it  defaults  to 1 inch.  If the height is absent it de‐
              faults to the width.  Example:

                     .MPIMG -L -G 2c foo.png 3c 1.5c

              The height and width may also  be  given  as  percentages.   The
              PostScript  device calculates the width from the [1m.l [22mregister and
              the height from the [1m.p [22mregister.  For example:

                     .MPIMG -L -G 2c foo.png 15%

       [1m.HnS n [22mBegin heading.  The numeric heading level [4mn[24m is specified by  the
              first  parameter.   Use this macro if your headings contain URL,
              FTP or MTO macros.  Example:

                     .HnS 1
                     .HR
                     GNU Troff
                     .URL https://\:www\:.gnu\:.org/\:software/\:groff/
                     \[em]a
                     .URL http://www\:.gnu\:.org/ GNU
                     project.
                     .HR
                     .HnE

              In this case you might wish to disable automatic links to  head‐
              ings.  This can be done via [1m-P-l [22mfrom the command line.

       [1m.HnE   [22mEnd heading.

       [1m.LK    [22mForce [4mgrohtml[24m to place the automatically generated links at this

              the  [1mms  [22mmacro package which generates both an HTML title and an
              <H1> heading.  Use it to provide an HTML title as search  engine
              fodder  but  a  graphic title in the document.  The macro termi‐
              nates when a space or break is seen (.sp, .br).

       [1m.HEAD  [22mAdd arbitrary HTML data to the <head>  block.   Ignored  if  not
              processed with [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml[22m.  Example:

                     .HEAD "<link \
                       rel=""icon"" \
                       type=""image/png"" \
                       href=""http://foo.org//bar.png""/>"

       [1m.HTML  [22mAll  text after this macro is treated as raw HTML.  If the docu‐
              ment is processed without [1m-Thtml [22mor [1m-Txhtml [22mthen  the  macro  is
              ignored.  Internally, this macro is used as a building block for
              other higher‐level macros.

              For example, the [1mBGIMG [22mmacro is defined as

                     .de BGIMG
                     .   HTML <body background=\\$1>

       [1m.DC l text [color][0m
              Produce a drop capital.  The first parameter is the letter to be
              dropped and enlarged, the second parameter [1mtext [22mis the adjoining
              text whose height the first letter should not exceed.   The  op‐
              tional  third  parameter is the color of the dropped letter.  It
              defaults to black.

       [1m.CDS   [22mStart displaying a code section in constant width font.

       [1m.CDE   [22mEnd code display

       [1m.ALN [color] [percentage][0m
              Place section heading links automatically to  the  left  of  the
              main  text.  The color argument is optional and if present indi‐
              cates which HTML background color is to be used under the links.
              The  optional percentage indicates the amount of width to devote
              to displaying the links.  The default values are #eeeeee and  30
              for color and percentage width, respectively.  This macro should
              only be called once at the beginning  of  the  document.   After
              calling this macro each section heading emits an HTML table con‐
              sisting of the links in the left and the  section  text  on  the
              right.

       [1m.LNS   [22mStart  a  new  two‐column  table  with links in the left column.
              This can be called if the document has text before the first .SH
              and  if  .ALN is used.  Typically this is called just before the
              first paragraph and after the main title as  it  indicates  that
              text  after  this point should be positioned to the right of the
              left‐hand navigational links.

       [1m.LNE   [22mEnd a two‐column table.  This should be called at the end of the
              document if .ALN was used.

              Initialize  default  URL attributes to be used if this macro set
              is not used with the HTML device.  The macro set initializes it‐
              self with the following call

                     .LINKSTYLE blue CR \[la] \[ra]

              but these values will be superseded by a user call to LINKSTYLE.

[1mSection heading links[0m
       By  default  [4mgrohtml[24m generates links to all section headings and places

       roff - concepts and history of [4mroff[24m typesetting

[1mDescription[0m
       The  term [4mroff[24m denotes a family of document formatting systems known by
       names like [4mtroff[24m, [4mnroff[24m, and [4mditroff[24m.  A [4mroff[24m system consists of an in‐
       terpreter  for an extensible text formatting language and a set of pro‐
       grams for preparing output for various devices and file formats.  Unix‐
       like  operating  systems  often  distribute  a [4mroff[24m system.  The manual
       pages on Unix systems (“man pages”) and bestselling books  on  software
       engineering,  including Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie’s [4mThe[24m [4mC[24m [4mPro‐[0m
       [4mgramming[24m [4mLanguage[24m and W. Richard Stevens’s [4mAdvanced[24m [4mProgramming[24m [4min[24m  [4mthe[0m
       [4mUnix[24m [4mEnvironment[24m have been written using [4mroff[24m systems.  GNU [4mroff[24m—[4mgroff[24m—
       is arguably the most widespread [4mroff[24m implementation.

       Below we present typographical concepts that form the background of all
       [4mroff[24m implementations, narrate the development history of some [4mroff[24m sys‐
       tems, detail the command pipeline managed by [4mgroff[24m(1), survey the  for‐
       matting  language,  suggest  tips for editing [4mroff[24m input, and recommend
       further reading materials.

[1mConcepts[0m
       [4mroff[24m input files contain text interspersed with instructions to control
       the  formatter.   Even in the absence of such instructions, a [4mroff[24m for‐
       matter still processes its input in several ways, by filling, hyphenat‐
       ing,  breaking,  and adjusting it, and supplementing it with inter‐sen‐
       tence space.  These processes are basic to typesetting, and can be con‐
       trolled at the input document’s discretion.

       When a device‐independent [4mroff[24m formatter starts up, it obtains informa‐
       tion about the device for which it is preparing output  from  the  lat‐
       ter’s  description  file (see [4mgroff_font[24m(5)).  An essential property is
       the length of the output line, such as “6.5 inches”.

       The formatter interprets plain text files employing the Unix  line‐end‐
       ing convention.  It reads input a character at a time, collecting words
       as it goes, and fits as many words together on an  output  line  as  it
       can—this is known as [4mfilling.[24m  To a [4mroff[24m system, a [4mword[24m is any sequence
       of one or more characters that aren’t spaces or newlines.   The  excep‐
       tions separate words.

       A  [4mroff[24m  formatter attempts to detect boundaries between sentences, and
       supplies additional inter‐sentence space between them.  It  flags  cer‐
       tain  characters  (normally  “[1m![22m”, “[1m?[22m”, and “[1m.[22m”) as potentially ending a
       sentence.  When the formatter encounters one of  these  [4mend‐of‐sentence[0m
       [4mcharacters[24m  at  the end of an input line, or one of them is followed by
       two (unescaped) spaces on the same input line, it appends an inter‐word
       space  followed  by  an  inter‐sentence space in the output.  The dummy
       character escape sequence [1m\& [22mcan be used after an end‐of‐sentence char‐
       acter  to  defeat  end‐of‐sentence  detection  on a per‐instance basis.
       Normally, the occurrence of a visible non‐end‐of‐sentence character (as
       opposed to a space or tab) immediately after an end‐of‐sentence charac‐
       ter cancels detection of the end of a sentence.  However, several char‐
       acters are treated [4mtransparently[24m after the occurrence of an end‐of‐sen‐
       tence character.  That is, a [4mroff[24m does not cancel  end‐of‐sentence  de‐
       tection  when  it  processes them.  This is because such characters are
       often used as footnote markers or to close quotations  and  parentheti‐
       cals.   The  default  set  is  [1m"[22m,  [1m'[22m, [1m)[22m, [1m][22m, [1m*[22m, [1m\[dg][22m, [1m\[dd][22m, [1m\[rq][22m, and
       [1m\[cq][22m.  The last four are examples of [4mspecial[24m  [4mcharacters,[24m  escape  se‐
       quences  whose purpose is to obtain glyphs that are not easily typed at
       the keyboard, or which have special meaning to the formatter (like [1m\[22m).

       When an output line is nearly full, it is uncommon for  the  next  word
       collected  from  the  input to exactly fill it—typically, there is room
       left over only for part of the next word.  The process of  splitting  a
       word  so  that it appears partially on one line (with a hyphen to indi‐
       cate to the reader that the word has been broken) with its remainder on
       the next is [4mhyphenation.[24m  Hyphenation points can be manually specified;
       [4mgroff[24m also uses a hyphenation algorithm and  language‐specific  pattern
       files  to  decide which words can be hyphenated and where.  Hyphenation
       does not always occur even when the hyphenation rules for a word  allow
       it; it can be disabled, and when not disabled there are several parame‐
       ters that can prevent it in certain circumstances.

       Once an output line is full, the next word (or remainder of  a  hyphen‐
       ated one) is placed on a different output line; this is called a [4mbreak.[0m
       In this document and in [4mroff[24m discussions generally, a  “break”  if  not
       further  qualified  always refers to the termination of an output line.
       When the formatter is filling text, it introduces breaks  automatically
       to  keep output lines from exceeding the configured line length.  After
       an automatic break, a [4mroff[24m formatter [4madjusts[24m  the  line  if  applicable
       (see  below),  and then resumes collecting and filling text on the next
       output line.

       Sometimes, a line cannot be broken automatically.   This  usually  does
       not happen with natural language text unless the output line length has
       been manipulated to be extremely short, but  it  can  with  specialized
       text  like  program source code.  [4mgroff[24m provides a means of telling the
       formatter where the line may be broken without hyphens.  This  is  done
       with the non‐printing break point escape sequence [1m\:[22m.

       There  are  several ways to cause a break at a predictable location.  A
       blank input line not only causes a break, but by default it  also  out‐
       puts  a  one‐line  vertical  space  (effectively  a blank output line).
       Macro packages may discourage or disable this “blank  line  method”  of
       paragraphing in favor of their own macros.  A line that begins with one
       or more spaces causes a break.  The spaces are output at the  beginning
       of  the  next  line  without  being [4madjusted[24m (see below).  Again, macro
       packages may provide other methods of  producing  indented  paragraphs.
       Trailing  spaces  on  [4mtext[24m [4mlines[24m (see below) are discarded.  The end of
       input causes a break.

       After the formatter performs an automatic break, it may then [4madjust[24m the
       line,  widening inter‐word spaces until the text reaches the right mar‐
       gin.  Extra spaces between words are preserved.  Leading  and  trailing
       spaces  are handled as noted above.  Text can be aligned to the left or
       right margin only, or centered, using [4mrequests.[0m

       A [4mroff[24m formatter translates horizontal tab characters, also called sim‐
       ply  “tabs”,  in  the input into movements to the next tab stop.  These
       tab stops are by default located every half inch measured from the cur‐
       rent position on the input line.  With them, simple tables can be made.
       However, this method can be deceptive, as the appearance (and width) of
       the  text  in  an  editor  and  the results from the formatter can vary
       greatly, particularly when proportional  typefaces  are  used.   A  tab
       character does not cause a break and therefore does not interrupt fill‐
       ing.  The formatter provides facilities for sophisticated table  compo‐
       sition;  there  are  many  details  to  track  when using the “tab” and
       “field” low‐level features, so most users turn to the [4mtbl[24m(1) preproces‐
       sor to lay out tables.

   [1mRequests and macros[0m
       A  [4mrequest[24m  is an instruction to the formatter that occurs after a [4mcon‐[0m
       [4mtrol[24m [4mcharacter,[24m which is recognized at the beginning of an input  line.
       The  regular  control character is a dot “[1m.[22m”.  Its counterpart, the [4mno‐[0m
       [4mbreak[24m [4mcontrol[24m [4mcharacter,[24m a neutral apostrophe “[1m'[22m”, suppresses the break
       implied  by  some requests.  These characters were chosen because it is
       uncommon for lines of text in natural languages to begin with them.  If
       you  require a formatted period or apostrophe (closing single quotation
       mark) where the formatter is expecting a control character, prefix  the
       dot  or  neutral  apostrophe  with the dummy character escape sequence,
       “[1m\&[22m”.

       An input line beginning with a control character is  called  a  [4mcontrol[0m
       [4mline.[24m  Every line of input that is not a control line is a [4mtext[24m [4mline.[0m

       Requests  often  take [4marguments,[24m words (separated from the request name
       and each other by spaces) that specify details of the action  the  for‐
       matter is expected to perform.  If a request is meaningless without ar‐
       guments, it is typically ignored.  Of key importance are  the  requests
       that define macros.  Macros are invoked like requests, enabling the re‐
       quest repertoire to be extended or overridden.

       A [4mmacro[24m can be thought of as an abbreviation you can define for a  col‐
       lection  of control and text lines.  When the macro is [4mcalled[24m by giving
       its name after a control character, it is replaced with what it  stands
       for.   The  process  of  textual replacement is known as [4minterpolation.[0m
       Interpolations are handled as soon as they  are  recognized,  and  once
       performed, a [4mroff[24m formatter scans the replacement for further requests,
       macro calls, and escape sequences.

       In [4mroff[24m systems, the “[1mde[22m” request defines a macro.

   [1mPage geometry[0m
       [4mroff[24m systems format text under certain assumptions about  the  size  of
       the  output  medium,  or  page.  For the formatter to correctly break a
       line it is filling, it must know the line length, which it derives from
       the  page  width.   For it to decide whether to write an output line to
       the current page or wait until the next one,  it  must  know  the  page
       length.   A device’s [4mresolution[24m converts practical units like inches or
       centimeters to [4mbasic[24m [4munits,[24m a convenient length measure for the  output
       device or file format.  The formatter and output driver use basic units
       to reckon page measurements.  The device description file  defines  its
       resolution and page dimensions (see [4mgroff_font[24m(5)).

       A  [4mpage[24m is a two‐dimensional structure upon which a [4mroff[24m system imposes
       a rectangular coordinate system with its upper left corner as the  ori‐
       gin.  Coordinate values are in basic units and increase down and to the
       right.  Useful ones are therefore always positive  and  within  numeric
       ranges corresponding to the page boundaries.

       While  the  formatter (and, later, output driver) is processing a page,
       it keeps track of its [4mdrawing[24m [4mposition,[24m which is the location at  which
       the next glyph will be written, from which the next motion will be mea‐
       sured, or where a geometric object will  commence  rendering.   Notion‐
       ally,  glyphs are drawn from the text baseline upward and to the right.
       ([4mgroff[24m does not yet support right‐to‐left scripts.)  The [4mtext[24m  [4mbaseline[0m
       is  a  (usually invisible) line upon which the glyphs of a typeface are
       aligned.  A glyph therefore “starts” at  its  bottom‐left  corner.   If
       drawn  at  the  origin,  a  typical letter glyph would lie partially or
       wholly off the page, depending on whether, like “g”, it features a  de‐
       scender below the baseline.

       Such  a situation is nearly always undesirable.  It is furthermore con‐
       ventional not to write or draw  at  the  extreme  edges  of  the  page.
       Therefore  the  initial  drawing position of a [4mroff[24m formatter is not at
       the origin, but below and to the right of  it.   This  rightward  shift
       from the left edge is known as the [4mpage[24m [4moffset.[24m  ([4mgroff[24m’s terminal out‐
       put devices have page offsets of zero.)  The downward shift leaves room
       for a text output line.

       Text  is  arranged  on a one‐dimensional lattice of text baselines from
       the top to the bottom of the page.  [4mVertical[24m [4mspacing[24m  is  the  distance
       between adjacent text baselines.  Typographic tradition sets this quan‐
       tity to 120% of the type size.  The initial vertical  drawing  position
       is  one unit of vertical spacing below the page top.  Typographers term
       this unit a [4mvee.[0m

       Vertical spacing has an impact on page‐breaking decisions.   Generally,
       when  a  break  occurs, the formatter moves the drawing position to the
       next text baseline automatically.  If the formatter were already  writ‐
       ing  to  the last line that would fit on the page, advancing by one vee
       would place the next text baseline off the page.  Rather than let  that
       happen,  [4mroff[24m  formatters instruct the output driver to eject the page,
       start a new one, and again set the drawing position to  one  vee  below
       the page top; this is a [4mpage[24m [4mbreak.[0m

       When  the  last  line of input text corresponds to the last output line
       that fits on the page, the break caused by the end of input  will  also
       break  the  page,  producing  a useless blank one.  Macro packages keep
       users from having to confront this difficulty by setting “traps”; more‐
       over,  all but the simplest page layouts tend to have headers and foot‐
       ers, or at least bear vertical margins larger than one vee.

   [1mOther language elements[0m
       [4mEscape[24m [4msequences[24m start with the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter,[24m a  backslash  [1m\[22m,  and
       are  followed  by  at  least one additional character.  They can appear
       anywhere in the input.

       With requests, the escape and control characters can be  changed;  fur‐
       ther, escape sequence recognition can be turned off and back on.

       [4mStrings[24m store character sequences.  In [4mgroff[24m, they can be parameterized
       as macros can.

       [4mRegisters[24m store numerical values, including measurements.   The  latter
       are  generally in basic units; [4mscaling[24m [4munits[24m can be appended to numeric
       expressions to clarify their meaning when stored or interpolated.  Some
       read‐only predefined registers interpolate text.

       [4mFonts[24m are identified either by a name or by a mounting position (a non‐
       negative number).  Four styles are available on all devices.  [1mR [22mis “ro‐
       man”:  normal,  upright  text.   [1mB  [22mis [1mbold[22m, an upright typeface with a
       heavier weight.  [1mI [22mis [4mitalic[24m, a face that is oblique on typesetter out‐
       put  devices and usually underlined instead on terminal devices.  [1mBI [22mis
       [4m[1mbold‐italic[24m[22m, combining both of the foregoing style  variations.   Type‐
       setting  devices  group  these four styles into [4mfamilies[24m of text fonts;
       they also typically offer one or more [4mspecial[24m fonts  that  provide  un‐
       styled glyphs; see [4mgroff_char[24m(7).

       [4mgroff[24m  supports named [4mcolors[24m for glyph rendering and drawing of geomet‐
       ric objects.  Stroke and fill colors are distinct; the stroke color  is
       used for glyphs.

       [4mGlyphs[24m  are  visual  representation forms of [4mcharacters.[24m  In [4mgroff,[24m the
       distinction between those two elements is not  always  obvious  (and  a
       full  discussion  is  beyond  our scope).  In brief, “A” is a character
       when we consider it in the abstract: to make it a glyph, we must select
       a  typeface  with  which  to render it, and determine its type size and
       color.  The formatting  process  turns  input  characters  into  output
       glyphs.   A  few characters commonly seen on keyboards are treated spe‐
       cially by the [4mroff[24m language and may not look correct in output if  used
       unthinkingly;  they  are  the  (double) quotation mark ([1m"[22m), the neutral
       apostrophe ([1m'[22m), the minus sign ([1m-[22m), the backslash  ([1m\[22m),  the  caret  or
       circumflex accent ([1m^[22m), the grave accent ([1m`[22m), and the tilde ([1m~[22m).  All of
       these and more can be produced with [4mspecial[24m [4mcharacter[24m escape sequences;
       see [4mgroff_char[24m(7).

       [4mgroff[24m  offers [4mstreams[24m, identifiers for writable files, but for security
       reasons this feature is disabled by default.

       A further few language elements arise as page layouts become  more  so‐
       phisticated  and demanding.  [4mEnvironments[24m collect formatting parameters
       like line length and typeface.  A [4mdiversion[24m stores formatted output for
       later  use.  A [4mtrap[24m is a condition on the input or output, tested auto‐
       matically by the formatter, that is associated with a macro, calling it
       when that condition is fulfilled.

       Footnote  support  often exercises all three of the foregoing features.
       A simple implementation might work as follows.  A pair of macros is de‐
       fined:  one  starts a footnote and the other ends it.  The author calls
       the first macro where a footnote marker is desired.  The  macro  estab‐
       lishes  a diversion so that the footnote text is collected at the place
       in the body text where its corresponding marker appears.   An  environ‐
       ment  is  created for the footnote so that it is set at a smaller type‐
       face.  The footnote text is formatted in the diversion using that envi‐
       ronment, but it does not yet appear in the output.  The document author
       calls the footnote end macro, which returns to the previous environment
       and  ends the diversion.  Later, after much more body text in the docu‐
       ment, a trap, set a small distance above the page  bottom,  is  sprung.
       The macro called by the trap draws a line across the page and emits the
       stored diversion.  Thus, the footnote is rendered.

[1mHistory[0m
       Computer‐driven document formatting dates back to the 1960s.  The  [4mroff[0m
       system  is intimately connected with Unix, but its origins lie with the
       earlier operating systems CTSS, GECOS, and Multics.

   [1mThe predecessor—[4mRUNOFF[0m
       [4mroff[24m’s ancestor [4mRUNOFF[24m was written in the MAD language by Jerry Saltzer
       to  prepare  his  Ph.D.  thesis  on  the Compatible Time Sharing System
       (CTSS), a project of the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology  (MIT).
       This  program  is  referred to in full capitals, both to distinguish it
       from its many descendants, and because bits  were  expensive  in  those
       days;  five‐  and  six‐bit character encodings were still in widespread
       usage, and mixed‐case alphabetics in  file  names  seen  as  a  luxury.
       [4mRUNOFF[24m introduced a syntax of inlining formatting directives amid docu‐
       ment text, by beginning a line with a period (an unlikely occurrence in
       human‐readable  material)  followed by a “control word”.  Control words
       with obvious meaning like “.line length [4mn[24m” were supported as well as an
       abbreviation system; the latter came to overwhelm the former in popular
       usage and later derivatives of the program.  A sample of control  words
       from  a  [4mRUNOFF[24m manual of December 1966 was documented as follows (with
       the parameter notation slightly altered).  The  abbreviations  will  be
       familiar to [4mroff[24m veterans.

                           Abbreviation   Control word

                                    [1m.sp   [22m.space [[4mn[24m]

       In  1965, MIT’s Project MAC teamed with Bell Telephone Laboratories and
       General Electric (GE) to inaugurate the Multics project.  After  a  few
       years,  Bell  Labs  discontinued its participation in Multics, famously
       prompting the development of Unix.  Meanwhile, Saltzer’s [4mRUNOFF[24m  proved
       influential, seeing many ports and derivations elsewhere.

       In  1969,  Doug  McIlroy wrote one such reimplementation, adding exten‐
       sions, in the BCPL language for a GE 645 running GECOS at the Bell Labs
       location  in  Murray Hill, New Jersey.  In its manual, the control com‐
       mands were termed “requests”, their two‐letter  names  were  canonical,
       and  the  control character was configurable with a [1m.cc [22mrequest.  Other
       familiar requests emerged at this time; no‐adjust  ([1m.na[22m),  need  ([1m.ne[22m),
       page  offset  ([1m.po[22m),  tab  configuration ([1m.ta[22m, though it worked differ‐
       ently), temporary indent ([1m.ti[22m), character translation ([1m.tr[22m), and  auto‐
       matic  underlining  ([1m.ul[22m; on [4mRUNOFF[24m you had to backspace and underscore
       in the input yourself).  [1m.fi [22mto enable filling of output lines got  the
       name it retains to this day.  McIlroy’s program also featured a heuris‐
       tic system for automatically placing hyphenation points,  designed  and
       implemented  by  Molly Wagner.  It furthermore introduced numeric vari‐
       ables, termed registers.  By 1971, this program had been ported to Mul‐
       tics and was known as [4mroff[24m, a name McIlroy attributes to Bob Morris, to
       distinguish it from CTSS [4mRUNOFF[24m.

   [1mUnix and [4mroff[0m
       McIlroy’s [4mroff[24m was one of the first Unix programs.  In Ritchie’s  term,
       it  was  “transliterated”  from BCPL to DEC PDP‐7 assembly language for
       the fledgling Unix operating system.  Automatic hyphenation was managed
       with  [1m.hc  [22mand  [1m.hy [22mrequests, line spacing control was generalized with
       the [1m.ls [22mrequest, and what later [4mroff[24ms would call diversions were avail‐
       able  via  “footnote”  requests.  This [4mroff[24m indirectly funded operating
       systems research at Murray Hill; AT&T prepared patent  applications  to
       the U.S. government with it.  This arrangement enabled the group to ac‐
       quire a PDP‐11; [4mroff[24m promptly proved equal to the  task  of  formatting
       the  manual  for what would become known as “First Edition Unix”, dated
       November 1971.

       Output from all of the foregoing programs was limited to line  printers
       and  paper  terminals such as the IBM 2471 (based on the Selectric line
       of typewriters) and the Teletype Corporation Model 37.   Proportionally
       spaced type was unavailable.

   [1mNew [4mroff[24m and Typesetter [4mroff[0m
       The first years of Unix were spent in rapid evolution.  The practicali‐
       ties of preparing standardized documents like patent applications  (and
       Unix  manual  pages), combined with McIlroy’s enthusiasm for macro lan‐
       guages, perhaps created an irresistible pressure to make [4mroff[24m  extensi‐
       ble.   Joe  Ossanna’s [4mnroff[24m, literally a “new roff”, was the outlet for
       this pressure.  By the time of Unix Version 3 (February 1973)—and still
       in  PDP‐11 assembly language—it sported a swath of features now consid‐
       ered essential to [4mroff[24m systems: definition of macros  ([1m.de[22m),  diversion
       of  text  thither ([1m.di[22m), and removal thereof ([1m.rm[22m); trap planting ([1m.wh[22m;
       “when”) and relocation ([1m.ch[22m; “change”); conditional  processing  ([1m.if[22m);
       and  environments  ([1m.ev[22m).  Incremental improvements included assignment
       of the next page number ([1m.pn[22m); no‐space mode ([1m.ns[22m) and  restoration  of
       vertical  spacing  ([1m.rs[22m); the saving ([1m.sv[22m) and output ([1m.os[22m) of vertical
       space; specification of replacement characters for tabs ([1m.tc[22m) and lead‐
       ers  ([1m.lc[22m);  configuration  of  the  no‐break  control character ([1m.c2[22m);
       shorthand to disable automatic hyphenation  ([1m.nh[22m);  a  condensation  of
       what  were  formerly  six  different requests for configuration of page
       “titles” (headers and footers) into one ([1m.tl[22m) with a length  controlled
       separately  from the line length ([1m.lt[22m); automatic line numbering ([1m.nm[22m);
       interactive input ([1m.rd[22m), which necessitated buffer‐flushing ([1m.fl[22m),  and
       was made convenient with early program cessation ([1m.ex[22m); source file in‐
       clusion in its modern form ([1m.so[22m; though [4mRUNOFF[24m had an “.append” control
       word for a similar purpose) and early advance to the next file argument
       ([1m.nx[22m); ignorable content ([1m.ig[22m); and programmable abort ([1m.ab[22m).

       Third Edition Unix also brought the [4mpipe[24m(2) system call, the  explosive
       growth  of a componentized system based around it, and a “filter model”
       that remains perceptible today.  Equally  importantly,  the  Bell  Labs
       site  in  Murray Hill acquired a Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter,
       and with it came the necessity of expanding the capabilities of a  [4mroff[0m
       system  to  cope  with  a variety of proportionally spaced typefaces at
       multiple sizes.  Ossanna wrote a parallel implementation of  [4mnroff[24m  for
       the  C/A/T,  dubbing  it [4mtroff[24m (for “typesetter roff”).  Unfortunately,
       surviving documentation does not illustrate what requests  were  imple‐
       mented  at this time for C/A/T support; the [4mtroff[24m(1) man page in Fourth
       Edition Unix (November 1973) does not feature a  request  list,  unlike
       [4mnroff[24m(1).   Apart from typesetter‐driven features, Unix Version 4 [4mroff[24ms
       added string definitions ([1m.ds[22m); made the escape character  configurable
       ([1m.ec[22m);  and enabled the user to write diagnostics to the standard error
       stream ([1m.tm[22m).  Around 1974, empowered with multiple type  sizes,  ital‐
       ics, and a symbol font specially commissioned by Bell Labs from Graphic
       Systems, Kernighan and Lorinda Cherry implemented [4meqn[24m  for  typesetting
       mathematics.   In  the  same year, for Fifth Edition Unix, Ossanna com‐
       bined and reimplemented the two [4mroff[24ms in C, using that language’s  pre‐
       processor to generate both from a single source tree.

       Ossanna  documented  the  syntax of the input language to the [4mnroff[24m and
       [4mtroff[24m programs in the “Troff User’s Manual”, first published  in  1976,
       with  further  revisions  as  late as 1992 by Kernighan.  (The original
       version was entitled “Nroff/Troff User’s Manual”, which  may  partially
       explain  why  [4mroff[24m practitioners have tended to refer to it by its AT&T
       document identifier, “CSTR #54”.)  Its final revision serves as the  [4mde[0m
       [4mfacto[24m  specification  of AT&T [4mtroff[24m, and all subsequent implementors of
       [4mroff[24m systems have done so in its shadow.

       A small and simple set of [4mroff[24m macros was first  used  for  the  manual
       pages of Unix Version 4 and persisted for two further releases, but the
       first macro package to be formally described and installed  was  [4mms[24m  by
       Michael  Lesk  in Version 6.  He also wrote a manual, “Typing Documents
       on the Unix System”, describing [4mms[24m and basic [4mnroff[24m/[4mtroff[24m usage,  updat‐
       ing it as the package accrued features.  Sixth Edition additionally saw
       the debut of the [4mtbl[24m preprocessor for formatting tables, also by Lesk.

       For Unix Version 7 (January 1979), McIlroy designed,  implemented,  and
       documented  the  [4mman[24m  macro package, introducing most of the macros de‐
       scribed in [4mgroff_man[24m(7) today, and edited volume 1  of  the  Version  7
       manual  using  it.   Documents  composed using [4mms[24m featured in volume 2,
       edited by Kernighan.

       Meanwhile, [4mtroff[24m proved popular even at Unix sites that lacked a  C/A/T
       device.   Tom  Ferrin  of the University of California at San Francisco
       combined it with  Allen  Hershey’s  popular  vector  fonts  to  produce
       [4mvtroff[24m, which translated [4mtroff[24m’s output to the command language used by
       Versatec and Benson‐Varian plotters.

       Ossanna had passed away unexpectedly in 1977, and after the release  of
       Version 7, with the C/A/T typesetter becoming supplanted by alternative
       devices such as the Mergenthaler Linotron 202,  Kernighan  undertook  a
       revision  and  rewrite of [4mtroff[24m to generalize its design.  To implement
       this revised architecture, he developed the font and device description
       file  formats  and the page description language that remain in use to‐
       day.  He described these novelties in the article  “A  Typesetter‐inde‐
       pendent TROFF”, last revised in 1982, and like the [4mtroff[24m manual itself,
       it is widely known by a shorthand, “CSTR #97”.

       Kernighan’s innovations prepared [4mtroff[24m well for the introduction of the
       Adobe  PostScript language in 1982 and a vibrant market in laser print‐
       ers with built‐in interpreters for it.   An  output  driver  for  Post‐
       Script, [4mdpost[24m, was swiftly developed.  However, AT&T’s software licens‐
       ing practices kept Ossanna’s [4mtroff[24m, with  its  tight  coupling  to  the
       C/A/T’s  capabilities, in parallel distribution with device‐independent
       [4mtroff[24m throughout the 1980s.  Today, however,  all  actively  maintained
       [4mtroff[24ms follow Kernighan’s device‐independent design.

   [4m[1mgroff[24m—a free [4mroff[24m from GNU[0m
       The  most  important free [4mroff[24m project historically has been [4mgroff[24m, the
       GNU implementation of [4mtroff[24m, developed by James Clark starting in  1989
       and distributed under copyleft licenses, ensuring to all the availabil‐
       ity of source code and the freedom to modify and redistribute it, prop‐
       erties  unprecedented in [4mroff[24m systems to that point.  [4mgroff[24m rapidly at‐
       tracted contributors, and has served as a replacement  for  almost  all
       applications  of AT&T [4mtroff[24m (exceptions include [4mmv[24m, a macro package for
       preparation of viewgraphs and slides, and the [4mideal[24m preprocessor, which
       produces  diagrams from mathematical constraints).  Beyond that, it has
       added numerous features; see [4mgroff_diff[24m(7).  Since  its  inception  and
       for  at  least the following three decades, it has been used by practi‐
       cally all GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems.

       [4mgroff[24m continues to be developed, is available for almost all  operating
       systems  in  common use (along with several obscure ones), and is free.
       These factors make [4mgroff[24m the [4mde[24m [4mfacto[24m [4mroff[24m standard today.

   [1mOther free [4mroff[24ms[0m
       In 2007, Caldera/SCO and Sun Microsystems, having  acquired  rights  to
       AT&T  Documenter’s Workbench (DWB) [4mtroff[24m (a descendant of the Bell Labs
       code), released it under a free but GPL‐incompatible license.  This im‐
       plementation was made portable to modern POSIX systems, and adopted and
       enhanced first by Gunnar Ritter and then Carsten Kunze to produce Heir‐
       loom Doctools [4mtroff[24m.

       In  July  2013, Ali Gholami Rudi announced [4mneatroff[24m, a permissively li‐
       censed new implementation.

       Another descendant of DWB  [4mtroff[24m  is  part  of  Plan 9 from User Space.
       Since 2021, this [4mtroff[24m has been available under permissive terms.

[1mUsing [4mroff[0m
       When  you  read  a  man page, often a [4mroff[24m is the program rendering it.
       Some [4mroff[24m implementations provide wrapper programs that make it easy to
       use  the  [4mroff[24m system from the shell’s command line.  These can be spe‐
       cific to a macro package, like [4mmmroff[24m(1), or  more  general.   [4mgroff[24m(1)
       provides  command‐line  options  sparing the user from constructing the
       long, order‐dependent pipelines familiar to AT&T [4mtroff[24m users.  Further,
       a  heuristic  program, [4mgrog[24m(1), is available to infer from a document’s
       contents which [4mgroff[24m arguments should be used to process it.

   [1mThe [4mroff[24m pipeline[0m
       A typical [4mroff[24m document is prepared by running one or  more  processors
       in  series, followed by a a formatter program and then an output driver
       (or “device postprocessor”).  Commonly, these programs  are  structured
       into  a pipeline; that is, each is run in sequence such that the output
       of one is taken as the input to the next, without passing through  sec‐
       ondary  storage.   (On non‐Unix systems, pipelines may have to be simu‐
       lated with temporary files.)

                  [1m| [4m[22moutput‐driver[0m

       Once all preprocessors have run, they deliver pure [4mroff[24m language  input
       to the formatter, which in turn generates a document in a page descrip‐
       tion language that is then interpreted by a postprocessor for  viewing,
       printing, or further processing.

       Each  program interprets input in a language that is independent of the
       others; some are purely descriptive, as with [4mtbl[24m(1)  and  [4mroff[24m  output,
       and  some  permit the definition of macros, as with [4meqn[24m(1) and [4mroff[24m in‐
       put.  Most [4mroff[24m input files employ the macros of a document  formatting
       package,  intermixed  with  instructions for one or more preprocessors,
       and seasoned with escape sequences and requests from the [4mroff[24m language.
       Some  documents are simpler still, since their formatting packages dis‐
       courage direct use of [4mroff[24m requests; man pages are a prominent example.
       Many features of the [4mroff[24m language are seldom needed by users; only au‐
       thors of macro packages require a substantial command of them.

   [1mPreprocessors[0m
       A [4mroff[24m preprocessor is a program that, directly or  ultimately,  gener‐
       ates output in the [4mroff[24m language.  Typically, each preprocessor defines
       a language of its own that transforms its input into that for  [4mroff[24m  or
       another  preprocessor.   As an example of the latter, [4mchem[24m produces [4mpic[0m
       input.  Preprocessors must consequently be run in an appropriate order;
       [4mgroff[24m(1)  handles  this automatically for all preprocessors supplied by
       the GNU [4mroff[24m system.

       Portions of the document written in preprocessor languages are  usually
       bracketed by tokens that look like [4mroff[24m macro calls.  [4mroff[24m preprocessor
       programs transform only the regions of the document intended for  them.
       When  a  preprocessor language is used by a document, its corresponding
       program must process it before the input is seen by the  formatter,  or
       incorrect rendering is almost guaranteed.

       GNU  [4mroff[24m provides several preprocessors, including [4meqn[24m, [4mgrn[24m, [4mpic[24m, [4mtbl[24m,
       [4mrefer[24m, and [4msoelim[24m.  See [4mgroff[24m(1) for a complete list.  Other preproces‐
       sors for [4mroff[24m systems are known.

              [4mdformat[24m   depicts data structures;
              [4mgrap[24m      constructs statistical charts; and
              [4mideal[24m     draws diagrams using a constraint‐based language.

   [1mFormatter programs[0m
       A [4mroff[24m formatter transforms [4mroff[24m language input into a single file in a
       page description language, described in [4mgroff_out[24m(5), intended for pro‐
       cessing  by  a selected device.  This page description language is spe‐
       cialized in its parameters, but not its syntax, for  the  selected  de‐
       vice;  the  format is device‐[4mindependent[24m, but not device‐[4magnostic[24m.  The
       parameters the formatter uses to arrange the document are stored in [4mde‐[0m
       [4mvice[24m and [4mfont[24m [4mdescription[24m [4mfiles[24m; see [4mgroff_font[24m(5).

       AT&T  Unix  had two formatters—[4mnroff[24m for terminals, and [4mtroff[24m for type‐
       setters.  Often, the name [4mtroff[24m is used loosely to refer to both.  When
       generalizing thus, [4mgroff[24m documentation prefers the term “[4mroff[24m”.  In GNU
       [4mroff[24m, the formatter program is always [4mtroff[24m(1).

   [1mDevices and output drivers[0m
       To a [4mroff[24m system, a [4mdevice[24m is a hardware interface like  a  printer,  a
       text  or  graphical  terminal, or a standardized file format that unre‐
       lated software can interpret.  An  [4moutput[24m  [4mdriver[24m  is  a  program  that
       parses  the  output  of [4mtroff[24m and produces instructions specific to the
       device or file format it supports.  An output driver might support mul‐
       tiple devices, particularly if they are similar.

       The  names  of  the devices and their driver programs are not standard‐
       ized.  Technological fashions evolve; the  devices  used  for  document
       preparation  when  AT&T  [4mtroff[24m  was  first  written in the 1970s are no
       longer used  in  production  environments.   Device  capabilities  have
       tended  to  increase,  improving  resolution  and  font repertoire, and
       adding color output and hyperlinking.  Further, to reduce file size and
       processing time, AT&T [4mtroff[24m’s page description language placed low lim‐
       its on the magnitudes of some quantities it could represent.  Its Post‐
       Script output driver, [4mdpost[24m(1), had a resolution of 720 units per inch;
       [4mgroff[24m’s [4mgrops[24m(1) uses 72,000.

[4m[1mroff[24m programming[0m
       Documents using [4mroff[24m are normal text files interleaved with  [4mroff[24m  for‐
       matting  elements.  The [4mroff[24m language is powerful enough to support ar‐
       bitrary computation and it supplies facilities  that  encourage  exten‐
       sion.   The  primary  such facility is macro definition; with this fea‐
       ture, macro packages have been developed that are tailored for particu‐
       lar applications.

   [1mMacro packages[0m
       Macro  packages  can  have  a much smaller vocabulary than [4mroff[24m itself;
       this trait combined with their domain‐specific  nature  can  make  them
       easy  to  acquire  and  master.  The macro definitions of a package are
       typically kept in a file called  [4mname[24m[1m.tmac  [22m(historically,  [1mtmac.[4m[22mname[24m).
       Find  details  on  the  naming  and  placement  of  macro  packages  in
       [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5).

       A macro package anticipated for use in a document can  be  declared  to
       the  formatter by the command‐line option [1m-m[22m; see [4mtroff[24m(1).  It can al‐
       ternatively be specified within a document using the [1mmso [22mrequest of the
       [4mgroff[24m language; see [4mgroff[24m(7).

       Well‐known  macro  packages  include  [4mman[24m for traditional man pages and
       [4mmdoc[24m for BSD‐style manual pages.  Macro packages for typesetting books,
       articles,  and letters include [4mms[24m (from “manuscript macros”), [4mme[24m (named
       by a system administrator from the first name of its creator, Eric All‐
       man), [4mmm[24m (from “memorandum macros”), and [4mmom[24m, a punningly named package
       exercising many [4mgroff[24m extensions.  See [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5) for more.

   [1mThe [4mroff[24m formatting language[0m
       The [4mroff[24m language provides requests, escape sequences, macro definition
       facilities,  string  variables, registers for storage of numbers or di‐
       mensions, and control of execution flow.  The theoretically minded will
       observe that a [4mroff[24m is not a mere markup language, but Turing‐complete.
       It has storage (registers), it can perform tests (as in conditional ex‐
       pressions like “[1m(\n[i] >= 1)[22m”), its “[1mif[22m” and related requests alter the
       flow of control, and macro definition permits unbounded recursion.

       [4mRequests[24m and [4mescape[24m [4msequences[24m are instructions, predefined parts of the
       language, that perform formatting operations, interpolate stored mater‐
       ial, or otherwise change the state of the parser.  The user can  define
       their  own  request‐like elements by composing together text, requests,
       and escape sequences [4mad[24m [4mlibitum.[24m  A document writer will not  (usually)
       note  any difference in usage for requests or macros; both are found on
       control lines.  However, there is a distinction; requests take either a
       fixed  number  of arguments (sometimes zero), silently ignoring any ex‐
       cess, or consume the rest of the input line, whereas macros can take  a
       variable number of arguments.  Since arguments are separated by spaces,
       macros require a means of embedding a space in an  argument;  in  other
       words,  of  quoting it.  This then demands a mechanism of embedding the
       quoting character itself, in case [4mit[24m is needed literally in a macro ar‐
       gument.  AT&T [4mtroff[24m had complex rules involving the placement and repe‐
       tition of the double quote to achieve both aims.  [4mgroff[24m cuts this  knot
       by  supporting a special character escape sequence for the neutral dou‐
       ble quote, “[1m\[dq][22m”, which never performs  quoting  in  the  typesetting
       language, but is simply a glyph, ‘[1m"[22m’.

       [4mEscape[24m  [4msequences[24m  start with a backslash, “[1m\[22m”.  They can appear almost
       anywhere, even in the midst of text on a line,  and  implement  various
       features,  including the insertion of special characters with “[1m\([4mxx[24m[22m” or
       “[1m\[[4mxxx[24m][22m”, break suppression at  input  line  endings  with  “[1m\c[22m”,  font
       changes  with  “[1m\f[22m”, type size changes with “[1m\s[22m”, in‐line comments with
       “[1m\"[22m”, and many others.

       [4mStrings[24m store text.  They are populated with the [1mds [22mrequest and  inter‐
       polated using the [1m\* [22mescape sequence.

       [4mRegisters[24m  store  numbers and measurements.  A register can be set with
       the request [1mnr [22mand its value can be retrieved by  the  escape  sequence
       [1m\n[22m.

[1mFile naming conventions[0m
       The  structure  or  content  of a file name, beyond its location in the
       file system, is not significant to [4mroff[24m tools.  [4mroff[24m documents  employ‐
       ing  “full‐service” macro packages (see [4mgroff_tmac[24m(5)) tend to be named
       with a suffix identifying the package; we thus see file names ending in
       [4m.man[24m, [4m.ms[24m, [4m.me[24m, [4m.mm[24m, and [4m.mom[24m, for instance.  When installed, man pages
       tend to be named with the manual’s section number as the  suffix.   For
       example, the file name for this document is [4mroff.7[24m.  Practice for “raw”
       [4mroff[24m documents is less consistent; they are sometimes seen  with  a  [4m.t[0m
       suffix.

[1mInput conventions[0m
       Since [4mtroff[24m fills text automatically, it is common practice in the [4mroff[0m
       language to avoid visual composition of text in input  files:  the  es‐
       thetic appeal of the formatted output is what matters.  Therefore, [4mroff[0m
       input should be arranged such that it is easy for authors and maintain‐
       ers  to compose and develop the document, understand the syntax of [4mroff[0m
       requests, macro calls, and preprocessor languages used, and predict the
       behavior  of the formatter.  Several traditions have accrued in service
       of these goals.

       • Follow sentence endings in the input  with  newlines  to  ease  their
         recognition.   It  is  frequently  convenient to end text lines after
         colons and semicolons as well, as these typically precede independent
         clauses.   Consider  doing so after commas; they often occur in lists
         that become easy to scan when itemized by line, or constitute supple‐
         ments  to the sentence that are added, deleted, or updated to clarify
         it.  Parenthetical and quoted phrases are also  good  candidates  for
         placement on text lines by themselves.

       • Set your text editor’s line length to 72 characters or fewer; see the
         subsections below.  This limit, combined with the  previous  item  of
         advice,  makes  it  less  common that an input line will wrap in your
         text editor, and thus will help you perceive  excessively  long  con‐
         structions  in your text.  Recall that natural languages originate in
         speech, not writing, and that punctuation is correlated  with  pauses
         for breathing and changes in prosody.

       • Use [1m\& [22mafter “[1m![22m”, “[1m?[22m”, and “[1m.[22m” if they are followed by space, tab, or
         newline characters and don’t end a sentence.

       • In filled text lines, use [1m\& [22mbefore “[1m.[22m” and “[1m'[22m” if they are  preceded
         by  space, so that reflowing the input doesn’t turn them into control
         lines.

       • Do not use spaces to perform indentation or align columns of a table.
         Leading spaces are reliable when text is not being filled.

       • Comment  your  document.   It  is never too soon to apply comments to
         record information of use to future document  maintainers  (including
         your future self).  The [1m\" [22mescape sequence causes [4mtroff[24m to ignore the
         remainder of the input line.

       • Use the empty request—a control character followed immediately  by  a
         newline—to  visually  manage  separation  of material in input files.
         Many of the [4mgroff[24m project’s own documents use an  empty  request  be‐
         tween  sentences,  after  macro definitions, and where a break is ex‐
         pected, and two empty requests between paragraphs or  other  requests
         or  macro calls that will introduce vertical space into the document.
         You can combine the empty request with the comment escape sequence to
         include  whole‐line comments in your document, and even “comment out”
         sections of it.

       An example sufficiently long to illustrate most of  the  above  sugges‐
       tions in practice follows.  An arrow → indicates a tab character.

              arbitrary.
              .
              This association I can define by means of a clock by
              comparing the order of events furnished by the clock
              with the order of a given series of events.
              .
              We understand by a clock something which provides a
              series of events which can be counted,
              and which has other properties of which we shall speak
              later.

   [1mEditing with Emacs[0m
       Official  GNU  doctrine  holds that the best program for editing a [4mroff[0m
       document is Emacs; see [4memacs[24m(1).  It provides an [4mnroff[24m major mode  that
       is suitable for all kinds of [4mroff[24m dialects.  This mode can be activated
       by the following methods.

       When editing a file within Emacs the mode can be changed by typing “[4mM‐x[0m
       [1mnroff-mode[22m”,  where [4mM‐x[24m means to hold down the meta key (often labelled
       “Alt”) while pressing and releasing the “x” key.

       It is also possible to have the mode automatically selected when a [4mroff[0m
       file is loaded into the editor.

       • The most general method is to include file‐local variables at the end
         of the file; we can also configure the fill column this way.

                .\" Local Variables:
                .\" fill-column: 72
                .\" mode: nroff
                .\" End:

       • Certain file name extensions, such as  those  commonly  used  by  man
         pages, trigger the automatic activation of the [4mnroff[24m mode.

       • Technically, having the sequence

                .\" -*- nroff -*-

         in the first line of a file will cause Emacs to enter the [4mnroff[24m major
         mode when it is loaded into the buffer.  Unfortunately,  some  imple‐
         mentations of the [4mman[24m(1) program are confused by this practice, so we
         discourage it.

   [1mEditing with Vim[0m
       Other editors provide support for [4mroff[24m‐style files too, such as [4mvim[24m(1),
       an  extension  of the [4mvi[24m(1) program.  Vim’s highlighting can be made to
       recognize [4mroff[24m files by setting the [1mfiletype [22moption in a Vim  [4mmodeline[24m.
       For  this  feature to work, your copy of [4mvim[24m must be built with support
       for, and configured to enable, several features; consult  the  editor’s
       online  help topics “auto-setting”, “filetype”, and “syntax”.  Then put
       the following at the end of your [4mroff[24m files, after any Emacs configura‐
       tion:

                     .\" vim: set filetype=groff textwidth=72:

       Replace “groff” in the above with “nroff” if you want highlighting that
       does [4mnot[24m recognize many of the GNU extensions to [4mroff[24m, such as request,
       register, and string names longer than two characters.

       Multicians,  a  site by Multics enthusiasts, contains a lot of informa‐
       tion on the MIT projects CTSS and Multics, including [4mRUNOFF[24m; it is  es‐

   [1mManual pages[0m
       As  a system of multiple components, a [4mroff[24m system potentially has many
       man pages, each describing an aspect of it.  Unfortunately, there is no
       consistent  naming  scheme for these pages among the different [4mroff[24m im‐
       plementations.

       For GNU [4mroff[24m, the [4mgroff[24m(1) man page enumerates all man  pages  distrib‐
       uted with the system, and individual pages frequently refer to external
       resources as well as manuals distributed with [4mgroff[24m  on  a  variety  of
       topics.

       With  other  [4mroff[24ms,  you  are on your own, but [4mtroff[24m(1) might be a good
       starting point.
