We discuss other macros

.BR .HP ,
.BR .OP ,
.BR .PD ,
and
.BR .UC )
in subsection \(lqDeprecated features\(rq below.
.
.
.P
Throughout Unix documentation,
a manual entry is referred to simply as a \(lqman page\(rq,
regardless of its length,
without gendered implication,
and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.\" .SS "Input file format"
.\" ====================================================================
.P
Man pages should be encoded using Unicode basic Latin code points
exclusively,
and employ the Unix line-ending convention
(U+000A only).
.\" What about rare English words that require diacritics, and
.\" proper names that require more than basic Latin?
.\"
.\" sentence (including end-of-sentence detection)
.\" The above distinction works well with filling.
.\" Don't fill your input text yourself; let groff do the work.
.\" Also good for diffs.
.\" escape sequences--pretty much just "see Portability"
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Fundamental concepts"
.\" ====================================================================
.\" font (family, style [elsewhere known as face])
.\" type size
.\" typesetter (troff device, PostScript, PDF)
.\" terminal (nroff device, emulator, typewriter, TTY)
.I groff
is a programming system for typesetting:
we thus often use the verb \(lqto set\(rq in the sense
\(lqto typeset\(rq.
.
The formatter
.MR \%troff 1
collects words from the input and
.I fills
output lines with as many as will fit.
.
.I Words
are separated by spaces and newlines.
.\" Also tabs and leaders, but let's not discuss those in man(7).
.
A transition to a new output line is called a
.I break.
.
When formatted,
a word may be broken at hyphens,
at
.B \e%
or
.B \e:
escape sequences
(see subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below),
or at predetermined locations
if automatic hyphenation is enabled
(see the
.B \-rHY
option in section \(lqOptions\(rq below).
.
An output line may be supplemented with
.I inter-sentence space,
and then optionally
.I adjusted
with more space to a consistent line length
(see the
.B \-dAD
option).
.
.MR roff 7
details these processes.
.
.
.P
An input line that starts with a dot (.\&)
or neutral apostrophe (\(aq)
is a
.I control line.
.
To call a macro,
put its name after a dot on a control line.
.\" You never need to indent macro calls in man(7), or call them with
.\" the no-break control character.
.
We refer to macros in this document using this leading dot.
.
Some macros interpret
.I arguments,
words that follow the macro name.
.
A newline,
unless escaped
(see subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below),
marks the end of the macro call.
.
An input line consisting of a dot followed by a newline
is called the
.I empty request;
it does nothing.
.
.I Text lines
are input lines that are not control lines.
.
.
.P
We describe below several
.I man
macros that plant one-line
.I input traps:
the next input line that directly produces formatted output is treated
specially.
.
For
.I man
documents that follow the advice in section
\[lq]Portability\[rq] below,
this means that control lines using the empty request
and uncommented input lines ending with an escaped newline
do not spring the trap;
anything else does
(but see the
.B .TP
macro description).

as with
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE .
.
.
.br
.ne 2v
.P
Optional macro arguments are indicated by surrounding them with square
brackets.
.
If a macro accepts multiple arguments,
those containing space \" or tab (in Plan 9 troff [only?])
characters must be double-quoted to be interpreted correctly.
.
An empty macro argument can be specified with a pair of double-quotes
(""),
but the
.I man
package is designed such that this should seldom be necessary.
.
See section \(lqNotes\(rq below for examples of cases where better
alternatives to empty arguments in macro calls are available.
.
Most macro arguments will be formatted as text in the output;
exceptions are noted.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Document structure macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
Document structure macros organize a man page's content.
.
All of them break the output line.
.
.B .TH
(title heading)
identifies the document as a man page and configures the page headers
and footers.
.
Section headings
.RB ( .SH ),
one of which is mandatory and many of which are conventionally expected,
facilitate location of material by the reader and aid the man page
writer to discuss all essential aspects of the topic.
.
Subsection headings
.RB ( .SS )
are optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
controlled way.
.
Many technical discussions benefit from examples;
lengthy ones,
especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output from
the system,
are usefully bracketed by
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE .
.
When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand,
use
.BR .RS / .RE
to inset a region within a (sub)section.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TH " topic section"\c
.RI " [" footer-middle ]\c
.RI " [" footer-inside ]\c
.RI " [" header-middle ]
Determine the contents of the page header and footer.
.
.I roff
systems refer to these collectively as \(lqtitles\(rq.
.
The subject of the man page is
.I topic
and the section of the manual to which it belongs is
.I section.
.
This use of \(lqsection\(rq has nothing to do with the section headings
otherwise discussed in this page;
it arises from the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix
manuals.
.
See
.MR man 1
or
.MR intro 1
for the manual sectioning applicable to your system.
.
.I topic
and
.I section
are positioned together at the left and right in the header
(with
.I section
in parentheses immediately appended to
.IR topic ).
.
.I footer-middle
is centered in the footer.
.
The arrangement of the rest of the footer depends on whether
double-sided layout is enabled with the option
.BR \-rD1 .
.
When disabled (the default),
.I footer-inside
is positioned at the bottom left.
.
Otherwise,
.I footer-inside
appears at the bottom left on recto (odd-numbered) pages,
and at the bottom right on verso (even-numbered) pages.
.
The outside footer is the page number,
except in the continuous-rendering mode enabled by the option
.BR \-rcR=1 ,
in which case it is the
.I topic
and
.I section,
as in the header.
.
.I header-middle
is centered in the header.
.
If
.I section
is an integer between 1 and\~9 (inclusive),
there is no need to specify
.I header-middle;
.I an.tmac
will supply text for it.
.
The macro package may also abbreviate
.I topic
and
.I footer-inside
with ellipses
.RB ( .\|.\|.\& )
if they would overrun the space available in the header and footer,
respectively.
.
For HTML output,
headers and footers are suppressed.
.
.
.IP
Additionally,
this macro breaks the page,
resetting the number to\~1
(unless the
.B \-rC1
option is given).
.
This feature is intended only for formatting multiple
.I man
documents in sequence.
.
.
.IP
A valid
.I man
document calls
.B .TH
once,
early in the file,
prior to any other macro calls.
.
.
.IP
By convention,
.I footer-middle
is the date of the most recent modification to the man page source
document,
and
.I footer-inside
is the name and version or release of the project providing it.
.
.
.TP
.BR .SH " ["\c
.IR heading-text ]
Set
.I heading-text
as a section heading.
.
If no argument is given,
a one-line input trap is planted;
text on the next line
.\", which can be formatted with a macro, \" true but discouraged
becomes
.I heading-text.
.
The left margin is reset to zero to set the heading text in bold
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ),
and,
on typesetting devices,
slightly larger than the base type size.
.
If the heading font
.B \[rs]*[HF]
is bold,
use of an italic style in
.I heading-text
is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
.
The inset level is reset to 1,
setting the left margin to the value of the
.B IN \" TODO: future: BP or BI register ("base paragraph indentation")
register.
.
Text after
.I heading-text
is set as an ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
.
.IP
The content of
.I heading-text
and ordering of sections follows a set of common practices,
as has much of the layout of material within sections.
.
For example,
a section called \(lqName\(rq or \(lqNAME\(rq must exist,
must be the first section after the
.B .TH
call,
and must contain only text of the form
.RS \" Invisibly move left margin to current .IP indentation.
.RS \" Now indent further, visibly.
.IR topic [\c
.BI , " another-topic"\c
.RB "].\|.\|.\& \e\- "\c
.I summary-description
.RE \" Move left margin back to .IP indentation.

.
See
.MR man 7
for the conventions prevailing on your system.
.RE \" Move left margin back to standard position.
.
.
.TP
.BR .SS " ["\c
.IR subheading-text ]
Set
.I subheading-text
as a subsection heading indented between a section heading and an
ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
If no argument is given,
a one-line input trap is planted;
text on the next line
.\", which can be formatted with a macro, \" true but discouraged
becomes
.I subheading-text.
.
The left margin is reset to the value of the
.B SN
register to set the heading text in bold
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ).
.
If the heading font
.B \[rs]*[HF]
is bold,
use of an italic style in
.I subheading-text
is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
.
The inset level is reset to 1,
setting the left margin to the value of the
.B IN \" TODO: future: BP or BI register ("base paragraph indentation")
register.
.
Text after
.I subheading-text
is set as an ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
.
.TP
.B .EX
.TQ
.B .EE
Begin and end example.
.
After
.BR .EX ,
filling is disabled and a constant-width (monospaced) font is selected.
.
Calling
.B .EE
enables filling and restores the previous font.
.
.
.IP
Example regions are useful for formatting code,
shell sessions,
and text file contents.
.
An example region is not
a \(lqliteral mode\(rq
of any sort:
special character escape sequences must still be used to produce correct
glyphs for
.BR \(aq ,
.BR \- ,
.BR \(rs ,
.BR \(ha ,
.BR \(ga ,
and
.BR \(ti ,
and sentence endings are still detected and additional inter-sentence
space applied.
.
If the amount of additional inter-sentence spacing is altered,
the rendering of,
for instance,
regular expressions using
.B .\&
or
.B ?\&
followed by multiple spaces can change.
.
Use the dummy character escape sequence
.B \(rs&
before the spaces.
.
.

.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Paragraphing macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
An ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P )
like this one
is set without a first-line indentation at the current left margin.
.
In man pages and other technical literature,
definition lists are frequently encountered;
these can be set as \(lqtagged paragraphs\(rq,
which have one
.RB ( .TP )
or more
.RB ( .TQ )
leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an additional indentation.
.
The indented paragraph
.RB ( .IP )
macro is useful to continue the indented content of a narrative started
with
.BR .TP ,
or to present an itemized or ordered list.
.
All of these macros break the output line.
.
If another paragraph macro has occurred since the previous
.B .SH
or
.BR .SS ,
they
(except for
.BR .TQ )
follow the break with a default amount of vertical space,
which can be changed by the deprecated
.B .PD
macro;
see subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below.
.
They also reset the type size and font style to defaults
.RB ( .TQ
again excepted);
see subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq below.
.
.

the left margin,
as affected by
.B .RS
and
.BR .RE ,
is not.
.
.
.TP
.BR .TP " ["\c
.IR indentation ]
Set a paragraph with a leading tag,
and the remainder of the paragraph indented.
.
A one-line input trap is planted;
text on the next line,
which can be formatted with a macro,
becomes the tag,
which is placed at the current left margin.
.
The tag can be extended with the
.B \(rsc
escape sequence.
.
Subsequent text is indented by
.I indentation,
if specified,
and by the amount of the
.B IN
register otherwise.
.
If the tag is not as wide as the indentation,
the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,
at the applicable indentation,
and continues on the following lines.
.
Otherwise,
the descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the
tag.
.
.
.IP
The line containing the tag can include a macro call,
for instance to set the tag in bold with
.BR .B .

.IP \(bu
Option dashes are specified with the

.
.
.IP \(bu
Option arguments and command operands are presented in

(but see subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq below regarding terminals)
to cue the user that they must be replaced with appropriate text.
.
.
.IP \(bu
Symbols that are neither to be typed literally nor replaced at the
user's discretion appear in the roman style;
brackets surround optional arguments,
and an ellipsis indicates that the previous syntactical element may be
repeated arbitrarily.
.
.
.IP \(bu
The non-breaking adjustable space escape sequence
.B \e\(ti
is used to prevent the output line from being broken within the option
brackets;
see subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below.
.
.
.IP \(bu
The output line continuation escape sequence
.B \ec
is used with font style alternation macros to allow all three font
styles to be set without (breakable) space among them;
see subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below.
.
.
.IP \(bu
The dummy character escape sequence
.B \e&
follows the ellipsis when further text will follow after space on the
output line,
keeping its last period from being interpreted as the end of a
sentence
.\" ...because it is followed by characters that are transparent to
.\" end-of-sentence detection, and a newline...
and causing additional inter-sentence space to be placed after it.

Hyperlinked text is supported on HTML

When device support is unavailable or disabled with the

The arguments to

.
Use special character escape sequences to encode Unicode basic Latin

.
URIs can be lengthy;
rendering them can result in jarring adjustment or variations in line
length,
or
.I \%troff
warnings when a hyperlink is longer than an output line.
.
The application of non-printing break point escape sequences
.B \e:
after each slash
(or series thereof),
and before each dot
(or series thereof)
is recommended as a rule of thumb.
.
The former practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto a
separate output line,
and the latter helps the reader to avoid mistakenly interpreting a dot
at the end of a line as a period
(or multiple dots as an ellipsis).

.
The
.I man
macro package is limited in its font styling options,
offering only
.BR bold \~( .B ),
.I italic\c
.RB \~( .I ),
and roman.
.
Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.
.
The
.B .SM
and
.B .SB
macros set text in roman or bold,
respectively,
at a smaller type size;
these differ visually from regular-sized roman or bold text only on
typesetting devices.
.
It is often necessary to set text in different styles without
intervening space.
.
The macros

used to mark file or path names,
environment variables,

or
POSIX.1-2017;
acronyms;
and occurrences after the first of a technical term.
.
.
.P
Be frugal with italics for emphasis,
and particularly with bold.
.
Article titles and brief runs of literal text,
such as references to individual characters or short strings,
including section and subsection headings of man pages,
are suitable objects for quotation;
see the
.BR \e(lq ,
.BR \e(rq ,
.BR \e(oq ,
and
.B \e(cq
escape sequences in subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below.
.
.
.P
Unlike the above font style macros,
the font style alternation macros below set no input traps;
they must be given arguments to have effect.
.
Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.
.
If a space is required within an argument,
first consider whether the same result could be achieved with as much
clarity by using single-style macros on separate input lines.
.
When it cannot,
double-quote an argument containing embedded space characters.

Setting all three different styles within a word
presents challenges;
it is possible with the

Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output with

the result may not render comprehensibly on an output device you fail to

.P
The two major syntactical categories for formatting control in the
.I roff
language are requests and escape sequences.
.
Since the

requests and escape sequences,
one can,
in principle,
supplement the functionality of

.P
However,
using raw
.I groff
requests
(apart from the empty request
.RB \(lq . \(rq)\&
is likely to make your page render poorly when processed by other tools;
many of these attempt to interpret page sources directly for conversion
to HTML.
.
Some requests make implicit assumptions about things like character
and page sizes that may not hold in an HTML environment;
also,
many of these viewers don't interpret the full
.I groff
vocabulary,
a problem that can lead to portions of your text being omitted
or presented incomprehensibly.
.
.
.P
For portability to modern viewers,
it is best to write your page solely with the macros described in this
page
(except for the ones identified as deprecated,
which should be avoided).
.
The macros we have described as extensions
.RB ( .EX / .EE ,
.BR .SY / .YS ,
.BR .TQ ,
.BR .UR / .UE ,
.BR .MT / .ME ,
.BR .MR ,
and

should be used with caution,
as they may not be built in to some viewer that is important to your
audience.
.
See

Similar caveats apply to escape sequences.

Some escape sequences are however required for correct typesetting

On devices with large glyph repertoires,

several keyboard glyphs are mapped to code points outside the Unicode

In the title heading
.RB ( .TH ),
the date of the page's last revision is more important than packaging
information;
it should not be omitted.
.
Ideally,
a page maintainer will keep both up to date.
.
.
.IP
.B .IP
is sometimes ill-understood and misused,
especially when no marker argument is supplied\(eman indentation
argument is not required.
.
By setting an explicit indentation,
you may be overriding the reader's preference as set with the
.B \-rIN
option.
.
If your page renders adequately without one,
use the simpler form.
.
If you need to indent multiple (unmarked) paragraphs,
consider setting an inset region with
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
instead.
.
.
.IP
In the last example,
the empty argument does have a subtly different effect than its
suggested replacement:
the empty argument causes an additional space character to be
interpolated between the arguments \(lqtwo\(rq and \(lqthree\(rq\(embut
it is a regular breaking space,
so it can be discarded at the end of an output line.
.
It is better not to be subtle,
particularly with space,
which can be overlooked in source and rendered forms.
.
.
.TP
.RB \(bu " .RS" " doesn't indent relative to my indented paragraph."
.
The
.B .RS
macro sets the left margin;
that is,
the position at which an
.I ordinary
paragraph
.RB ( .P
and its synonyms)
will be set.
.
.BR .IP ,
.BR .TP ,
and the deprecated
.B .HP
use the same default indentation.
.
If not given an argument,
.B .RS
moves the left margin by this same amount.
.
To create an inset relative to an indented paragraph,
call
.B .RS
repeatedly until an acceptable indentation is achieved,
or give
.B .RS
an indentation argument that is at least as much as the paragraph's
indentation amount relative to an adjacent
.B .P
paragraph.
.
See subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq above for the
values.
.
.
.IP
Another approach you can use with tagged paragraphs is to place an
.B .RS
call immediately after the paragraph tag;
this will also force a break regardless of the width of the tag,
which some authors prefer.
.
Follow-up paragraphs under the tag can then be set with
.B .P
instead of
.BR .IP .
.
Remember to use
.B .RE
to end the indented region before starting the next tagged paragraph
(at the appropriate nesting level).

The
.B .RS
macro takes an

as an argument;
the

.B .RE\~1
goes to the level before any

.B .RE\~2
goes to the level of the first

\(bu Why doesn't the package provide a string to insert an ellipsis?
.
Examples of ellipsis usage are shown above,
in subsection \[lq]Command synopsis macros\[rq].
.
The idiomatic
.I roff
ellipsis is three dots (periods)
with thin space escape sequences
.B \[rs]|
internally separating them.
.
Since dots both begin control lines and are candidate end-of-sentence
characters,
however,
it is sometimes necessary to prefix and/or suffix an ellipsis with the
dummy character escape sequence
.BR \[rs]& .
.
That fact stands even if a string is defined to contain the sequence;
further,
if the string ends with
.BR \[rs]& ,
end-of-sentence detection is defeated when you use the string at the end
of an actual sentence.
.
(Ending a sentence with an ellipsis is often poor style,
but not always.)
.
A hypothetical string
.B EL
that contained an ellipsis,
but not the trailing dummy character
.BR \[rs]& ,
would then need to be suffixed with the latter
when not ending a sentence.

The first column practices a false economy;
the savings in typing is offset by the cost of obscuring even the
suggestion of an ellipsis to a casual reader of the source document,
and reduced portability to
.RI non- roff
man page formatters that cannot handle string definitions.
.
.
.IP
There is an ellipsis code point in Unicode,
and some fonts have an ellipsis glyph,
which some man pages have accessed in a non-portable way with the
font-dependent
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence.
.
We discourage the use of these;
on terminals,
they may crowd the dots into a half-width character cell,
and will not render at all if the output device doesn't have the glyph.
.
In syntax synopses,
missing ellipses can cause great confusion.
.
Dots and space are universally supported.
